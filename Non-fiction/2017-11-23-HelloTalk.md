I didn't subscribe to facebook and other social sites becaue of teh security issues, but more so because I didn't believe good friends could come from there.

Like Hello Talk because:
1. Mystery in the languages
2. People resort to simple communication, and behind those words a whole life and problems are hidden
   - Kind of like not to know the language fully, worried it won't sound magical


Some patterns I've noticed.

- Young 20 year olds
- 

Who were interesting:
- Met someone in real life and his family with mine, was not a good fit
- Woman who did an affair
- Person visiting NYC

One sentences from people: e.g. "I'm lonely."
