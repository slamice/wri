A case for a writing community

Sorry, she said, after seven no laptops allowed. It's just the thing here. It's a weekend, and, you know. Sorry.

Nevermind that I'd already been there twice before, and yes once on a Saturday night, with fewer than five people at a time in Cafe Cocoa. I'm not ready to write by hand in candelight, so I left but without a complaint. I've become complacent with this lonely city.

Bad for writers. You've uninvited to the cafe's if you're not having wine with your date. Hell, maybe then  the walls are all already covered in Grafitti. The paint around it all is chipping, but no doubt the original owners are coming back every of often giving each letter touch ups.

I'll admit, I don't know anything yet. I just moved here less than two years ago. But where are the mythical writers? Is there no scene left? When you get kicked out of the lower east side, what does that mean? Is it officially too gentrified and beautiful to be considered a mess to discover? Am I really destined to flog hipsters in between Bushwick warehouses for inspiration? Shut up, me?

They say writing is a solitary activity. You hole yourself up in a room, under a florecent desk lamp, and you type up your masterpiece. The words flow like fucking flow. And you emerge and do some readings, and they wonder wow how did that happen you're amazing or suck. You really fricked that flam... What a clever creature of the dark.

But I don't want to live in that dream. I want to be surrounded with muses and messes. Not everyone wants to wrap themselves up in robes on a mountain and be a buddhist like Salinger. Some have to steep in an environment like tea. When Burroughs hung around the beat hotel in Paris, he had many people encircling him, to mingle with and feed the passion of written and visualalites. People introduced him to the cut up method that built Naked Lunch. And they just inspired eachother, discussing fucking life, or just life.

New York, I thought, would be friendlies to deadbeats. But it eats my wallet and it seems its soul imploded in on itself. Cafes in Williamsburg with lines winding around the block because of their artisinal style. University cafes have people asleep in corners with "Material Girl" blaring over loud speakers. Cafes in Manhattan turn into bars after six. And those bars turn over tables and tabs in and out with driinks for drunks and funks.

Is it a waiting game? Community, where are you? Which rock are you hiding under?

Pop writing disgusts me. Let's write a novel to change the world. To change the conversation. But this city is pushing writers, literary writers, all to the edges. If you're really a progressive New York City, promote your writers. But, are you seriously asking, who needs writing when we have huge concrete blocks in on sidewalk corners? Each with a small plaque that reads "art, remember?" Or comedians hailed as philosophers with sold out readings at the Downtown Manhattan Library?

Please, New York City, give me one less reason, any day now, not to leave.
