Secret of the masons is the glue that colors and holds together cracks instantly.

Mr. Thander looked at him blandly then smiled, "Myboy Zain, of course to save space. Space... Is of unimaginable value."

"Well, if you can imagine, there was a time when everyone lived together. We started creating these buildings, building you see all over. We are the original masons.

We formed comittees and guilds for builders, but teh government always struck us down. We feel we gave it our all, to washington, to Jefferson, to all of them. But we were the bottom rung, and on top of building our own homes we had to pay rent for them.

So a silent revolt formed, then a very loud revolt, and a whole slew of us, hundreds if not thousands, were to be hung and guillitined for our dignity. Can you imagine! No you cannot imagine.

But a few of us, one day before the killings, decided to make a deal with the government. A deal that's been made thousands of years, as long as the masons built buildings. We decided to maintain the internals of structures, so they wouldn't mold or collapse, in exchange to be left alone and forgotten.

This was a very easy deal ot be made. Less mouths to be fed, while enjoying the splendor of masonary construction. At first it was quite difficult, but we had a few things that the governments and the landlords did not have. And tehy should never have, because then we'd be ruined all over again.""

"Some Dodo?"

Zain was stunned, "This is real Dodo?!"

"Yes well, you weren't using them, so we took them in. Like all the other animals you threw away. So we took them and they were put to use. I think they're much happier here."

The meat tasted like an equisite ostrich, something Zain had never tried. But he felt like he did, and it felt like something even better.
