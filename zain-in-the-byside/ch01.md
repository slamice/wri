Ch1. Moving to the City

Summary: Zain's father moved from the country to work at the power plant for money. They move in with his aunt. Zain is 10 years old. A power outage.
--------------------------------

Zain laid awake in his bed, hearing the clatter downstairs, the noises in the attic, the banging of the pipes in the walls. How could a kid sleep with such a racket? The upper west side apartment they moved to was not what his parents described to him at all.

"Glamorous~!!" his mother exclaimed.

"Class." His father said with a wink.

But so far the sounds kept him awake, night after night. When they lived out in the country he recognized everything. The crickets, the wind, the creaking wood. But what was here in the city that made such sounds? Everything was a grey or painted concrete. Also new brick or crumbling brick. The explanations were always the same.

"The building is old." his mother said one breakfast.

"But just because things are old doesn't mean they have to creak?"

"Things rot and rust and then they don't work." His father chimed in, "some things don't work right anymore and then they do stuff you don't expect. You'll get used to them I promise." 

The bags under his father's eyes were visible reminders of the suffering.

"What if I don't?" Zain asked, seriously. But his father shrugged happily, as if he shrugged his question out the window and repeated, "You'll get used to them, I promise."

Zain thought that was a weird promise but still tried getting used to them. One week passed, and another week, and a month, and then three months. Every night there were moments of silence, and then a loud bang in the wall, or a weird creak out the window. Only once did he recognize the sound of a pigeon fluttering by, but that was it.

And because of these sounds he could never get to sleep. He'd start to dream about his grandmother and riding his bike with her to the market, or picking strawberries on a weekend with his parents, because he loved strawberries. But the sounds woke him up and were disturbing, ugly and creepy. Because he didn't know what they were, so naturally they must be coming from some kind of monster. Even with the door left partially open, Zain had so much trouble sleeping. He was usually tired, and with school starting in two weeks he was worried he wouldn't be able to wake up in time for it.

Of course he asked his parents to inspect his room daily.

"Please, does the building manager know?"

"The building may be old Zain but it's not haunted or filled with monsters." His dad smiled, happily but sternly, "I know it's a lot, since we just moved, but give this place a chance."

Zain sighed a "Ok." But it was most not ok.


----

They moved away because Zain's Dad got a job in the powerplant near New York City. They moved in with their uncle in the upper west side so they could get Zain to a decent school. Even though Zain hated school, and much rather would have watched the birds and animals outside, chasing after them to see what kind they were, if they were any rarer than the others.

The only thing he had from his grandmother, which was her father's ruler. It was an old metal ruler, a real old one, but it wasn't rusted because his grandmother took care of it so well.

His window didn't face teh street but an alley that he never saw anyone in. It was between his building and his neighbor's. Just a dark grey empty court with nothing inside.
