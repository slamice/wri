Ch1. The City

The sounds kept Zain awake, night after night as long as he could remember since moving in with his Uncle. He heard the racket on the floor below. He listened uneasily to the noises in the attic. He heard the banging of the pipes deep within the walls. Zain had a hard time sleeping through all of it, and only until 1 or 2 a.m. after his father and uncle were home from the power plant did he fall asleep.

"This apartment is glamorous~!!" his mother exclaimed blankly.

"Class." His father said with a wink.

 The truth he knew was that his parents couldn't afford to move and barely made rent as it was. He only knew that because he heard them aruging about it once a week late into the night. 

"The building is too old." his mother would tell him over breakfast.

"But just because things are old doesn't mean they have to creak? Does the building manager know?"

"The building may be old Zain it's not haunted or filled with monsters." His dad smiled, happily but sternly, "I know it's a lot,"

Zain sighed an "Ok." But it was most not ok.

"Things rot and rust and then they don't work." His father chimed in, "some things don't work right anymore and then they do stuff you don't expect. You'll get used to them I promise." 

The bags under his father's eyes were visible reminders of his daily suffering. Zain's uncle sat on the other end of the table and nodded with a smile.

"What if I don't?" Zain asked, seriously. But his father shrugged happily, "You'll get used to them" he winked, "I promise."

Zain thought that was a weird promise for a father to make since his Dad had no control over something like that.

He was always tired. Too tired to stay awake in school, where he'd fall asleep in his morning classes and then nod off in front of the principle's office. Too tired to do prove if he was even any good at gym. 

In fact Zain's whole family were tired. Zain's mother worked at a laundromat six days a week. His father and uncle worked daily at the Harlem power plant. 

The summers when he had school off were worse. Because of the heat he'd open the windows at night, and combined with the building noises he'd hear the city outside. The car screeches and shouts from the people outside were louder than ever. It was all very frustrating.

Every week his parents sat down and tried to make sense of their finances. And Zain listened, as they tried to make sense of what they were going to do next. 

"Bills bills bills..." Zain heard his father sigh into the papers he shuffled.

"Bills bills bills..." Zain heard his mother tear open envelope after envelope.

Zain noticed the light down the hall flicker. "I have to replace that bulb. You know it's a miracle this building is still standing." Zain heard his father mumble.

"It's ~a miracle~ my brother could take us in. There's a reason for everything."

"I'm thankful honey, I swear I am." Zain's father coughed.

And on and on into the night. And the pipes clanked on and on into the night...
