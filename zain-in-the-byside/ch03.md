Ch3. SCREECH TOCK   WHIMP CLANK


One night, the pipes spoke to Zain again. Over and over. Zain heard the scratching sounds, the creaking. But Zain realized something about the pipes.

Everythign sounded uniform. The pipes woudl screech-

SCREECH

then tock-

TOCK TOCK TOCK TOCK

then pause-



then whimper-

WHIMP WHIMP WHIMP

then clank-

CLANK CLANK CLANK.

And they'd repeat, over and over. Was it a code? Was that the sound of a heater?
