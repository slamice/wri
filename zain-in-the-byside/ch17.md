They raced through the tunnels, and Zain had to be very careful not to lose sight of Mr. Husk and Josslyn. They snaked all over with cut corners and sides. It was a maze of aging brick and concrete with random bits of moss.

Eventually the man grabbed a hook suspended on a wall and it pulled him. He sped up the shaft and was at least 3 stories up when he got there. Husk raced to a hook underneath the previous one and asked Zain and Josslyn to hold on and to cover their mouths.

They raced up tight corners, thick with dust and soot. Mr. Husk jammed somethign in the hook where they paused in midair. You could see the fading mark in the wall that the man left. Before the scar on the wall faded completely away Mr. Husk threw himself back then kicked it in. All three of them fell through a wall into a vast department store. Clumped on top of eachother and looked up to see the man racing away.

Mr. Husk started patchign the hole in the wall again while Josslyn raced after the man with Zain. They jumped through clothes and shelves as the main threw back objects in their way. They jumped over cupboards and dodged broken dishes as they also noticed someone yelling from behind them.

"Hey!" a security guard yelled behind them. "Stop or we'll shoot!"

"You think they'll shoot?" Josslyn asked.

"Probably." And they ran faster around a corner, sliding down a rail to the 4th floor.
