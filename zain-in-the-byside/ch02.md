Zain's only friend was a pigeon who sat outside his window sill. One day on a whim he put some millet left over from dinner out his window, and a pigeon flew down to take some nips at it. It didn't happen often, but Zain always put some millet outside, and on the rare occassion the same bird would fly down to his window. Zain would imitate his "coo coo" and the bird stuck around.
