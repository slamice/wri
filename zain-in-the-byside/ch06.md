	          Theif
      Reward 4000 and then some
  Stole 800 goods across the byside
      Probably hates babies too
   Call the commionser office at 82

"It's horrible, a theif."

Then the theif hordes them, no one knows how it's eve possible to hide anything from anyone in the byside."

Mr. Husk shook his head, "Dispicable." He held on to his hat, it nearly flying off when someone walking on the ceiling hit it, "Horrific. But a very clever person nonetheless."

"Well you didn't want them so we took them back. They're so friendly you almost don't want to."

The dodo cocked its head and looked closely at Zain, then nipped a bit at his belt. Other dodos laid dormant.
