"There's a reason for everything, if it's good enough for you or you're good enough for it." - mole person girl's Dad






The poster had no picture on it. It read:

	          Theif
      Reward 4000 and then some
  Stole 800 goods across the byside
      Probably hates babies too
   Call the commionser office at 82

"It's horrible, a theif." Joceline turnned her head nearly right around to Zain, trodding in the tunnel effortlessly without looking in front of her "we already have so little, we can count the things we have. Then the theif hordes them, no one knows how it's eve possible to hide anything from anyone in the byside."

Mr. Husk shook his head, "Dispicable." He held on to his hat, it nearly flying off when someone walking on the ceiling hit it, "Horrific. But a very clever person nonetheless."
