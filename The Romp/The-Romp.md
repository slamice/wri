The Romp

She had it. It was something she was in posetion of. She craddled it with disgust. Tender love and care was an understatement.

She had boredom beyond belief. Illogically discomforted. ((Imagine that in your wind pipe and shove it. - maybe no?))

Not only that, but she was frustrated. With her life, with hr family, her cholesterol, her future, her past, the frustrating stuff. And she wanted it bad. If only her frustrations were ecstacy, then she would be queen of kingdom come.

But this woman set herself up to be disappointed. One brutal puncture in her life after another. This was even after she absorbed a mountain of self help books like a blob. Everyday her realizations threw her to the floor and screamed several personal epiphanies at a time. She was shocked and overjoyed that ¨Yea, that cookie from the cafe -meant- something" and "she didnt have to be a boat at sea, she could dock!". But then reality showed its knuckles to her and said shut up before I let logic bite you. For a mean one, and doesnt care about what dream you told your mom about on the phone last Saturday.

So she was alone, sobbing inside.

She lived in an apartment only a mother could love sarcastically. The woman was a mess, and her apartment made the man. Her lamp shade a towel, her coffee table a box of unpacked highschool trinkets, her castle a burnt pile of rubble.

Her work was mentally crippling and challenging. All she had left was a building frustration in a frustrating building. She was crippled by the fact her work was exhaustingly boring beyond belief. Everyday she pushed papers, and thats it. In fact, she was asked about her progress everyday.

"So, hows the paper pushing coming along?"

The difficulty of the job was to stay awake. It was a struggle when work was slow, when there werent many papers to push. She dreaded the laptop, for that reason. Nothing moved her in an office full of dead flies, except for the dead flies. Silence may have been bliss but it was killing her. She suffered.

The modern day frustrations. Monotonous and plentiful. She had friends but were the kind who would get you lilacs but you dont know how to take care of lilacs and they die and then they ask you "Where are the lilacs?" And you say they died and their face tell you your face is dumb. Thats it, all she had were selfish flower people.

Really, she was done. She looked out at the city. Some buildings were legs tripping over eachother. Others meandering pebbles. Everyday she walked through crowds, so many faces. They werent faceless . They all had them but couldnt face them. So many dorks... And they never seemed to pay the price of humiluating themselves through habit! Or improved their stature or walked their dogs more YOU MORONS.

Everyday she stood in a subway trains while backs hugged her at rush hour. Walls hugged her at the water cooler. The elevator gave her a wet kiss on the 9th floor.

Everyday with the humidity in a gusto wind, the heat off the sidewalk, the cold biting her, munching her comfort on the way home. She was weather's dinner, just another shank. The sweet sweat the sauce. Lamb Shankily she daydreamed kicking the ass of everyday weather for a more stable climate. She would shove all her sweaters and flip flops in its face "ha!" She'd scream.

I mean it when I say she had it. And since you cant really unhave something, semantics got in the way too, so she was pissed. Properly pissed. Not improperly irritated.

But really, what could she do? She sat in front of her desk pushing paper after paper, occassionally pulling. The office was all a buzz with telephone rings, hellos and nice days. "Hurumph¨ she mumbled in a moan. Hurumph indeed. She stared mindlessly at her hands, her fingers, her nails, etc.

A quick rush of blood to her head almost scalded her brain. Did she seriously have to fight her own body now? She'd been doing it forever. Far before puberty, if that's what you were thinking. More like when gravity didn't matter. Those were good times, hanging out, wobming.

Altogether, the agony was too much. There was the physical then the absolute abstract. How many peices of herself were left to give?

She got up, and stormed out of the office even when people ignored her as a dilemma, a nuisance only convenient in certain points in time. This wasn't a video game, and those people would still exist in the world in the end, and that still wasn't enough of a good punishment, so honestly God had his hands full and a few more people falling off the sides of those could use a good kick.

So she did, and the papers flew off their desks and into their faces, computers smashed with punches and goliath kicks. The office went suddenly silent and the only sounds left were her violence and their violent awkward glares. No one picked up the phone for security, not yet, too many people were in surprise, shock and some in awe, wondering why she wouldn't be a good person and just jump out the window in a quarter to third life crisis, wherever the math fit in for those who forgot how old she actually was.

There was a clear path to the elevator that bore no reseblance to the massive mess behind her, the prefect capitalist brick in ruins. Everything was torn out of capitalism's love for simple geometry by the seams. It was, what those seems may be, an awkward occurance to removing modern life drudgery. Many would like to claim they couldn't hurt the machine but even those who say it loudest know they didn't. Because community and love is hard. But everyone had to admit, after she set the fire in the kitchen and the desks in ten seconds flat that she made a pretty deep charred dent in it all.

The blaze perked everyone up and in a panic they shuffled into eachother down the staircases to get some exercise finally. The elevator opened for her as if on queue, and she went down the seven flights without a wicked thought in her head, only ones with drive and power, fast enough to break through a wall.

























Lost in a disarray of feeling and mischeif. Words dangled above her from the ceiling, and she didn't hold back from putting them in her mouth, calling them her own and then spitting that back out into people's faces.

They burst and blew into the room like a bomb like a train like a typhoon, soon to blow more. The lighting was as dim as him and it was about to go out. "No time for words" she whispered. "What?" He said. He grabbed her by the ankles and threw her against the wall. She ricocheted off of it and landed on the bed. "What an -animal-" she thought. "If he were a koala hed bite my head off". As she said this pieces of plaster trickled down over her like pennies being poured over a very rich pour guy. "Youre such a brute" she mewed, teasing the concrete out of her bangs. He coughed a little and said "What?".

He thought for a bit and he was done for the year.

"Thats just a sexcuse!" She screamed.

A reckless ganaching gnashing. She took the door apart with her bare everything. Pieces of wood and shrapnel and lead and barrier stormed into the room. The hinges were unhinged in many ways, shuddering.
"OH MY GOD" she screamed, and we all heard her. She swung open the closet doors and they gasped at her expansive wardrobe of plain clothes.
"COME TO MOMMA" she wailed, and a whale of clothes englufed her. She felt like Gepedo (from pinnocio) only more hopeless.

You have to understand how banal and plain this woman was. The joke was on her, everyday wearing a different shade of grey. Silent movies screamed at her wardrobe it was so hideous. But she was turning over a new leaf, burning down the forest and saving the amazon(s?) while hugging all the trees. Ripping, tearing and ruining her clothes, she sought style where there was none.
