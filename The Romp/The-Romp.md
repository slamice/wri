The Romp

She had it. It was something she was in posetion of. She craddled it with disgust. Tender love and care was an understatement.

She had boredom beyond belief. Illogically discomforted. Imagine that in your wind pipe and shove it.

Not only that, but she was frustrated. With her life, with hr family, her cholesterol, her future, her past, the frustrating stuff. And she wanted it bad. If only her frustrations were ecstacy, then she would be queen of kingdom come.

But this woman set herself up to be disappointed. One brutal puncture in her life after another.This was even after she absorbed a mountain of self help books like a blob. Everyday her realizations threw her to the floor and screamed several personal epiphanies at a time. She was shocked and overjoyed that ¨Yea, that cookie from the cafe -meant- something" and "she didnt have to be a boat at sea, she could dock!". But then reality showed its knuckles to her and said shut up before I let logic bite you. He's a mean one, and doesnt care about what dream you told your mom about on the phone last Saturday.

So she was alone, sobbing inside.

She lived in an apartment only a mother could love sarcastically. The woman was a mess, and her apartment made the man. Her lamp shade a towel, her coffee table a box of unpacked highschool trinkets, her castle a burnt pile of rubble.

Her work was mentally crippling and challenging. All she had left was a building frustration in a frustrating building. She was crippled by the fact her work was exhaustingly boring beyond belief. Everyday she pushed papers, and thats it. In fact, she was asked about her progress everyday.
"So, hows the paper pushing coming along?"
The difficulty of the job was to stay awake. It was a struggle when work was slow, when there werent many papers to push. She dreaded the laptop, for that reason. Nothing moved her in an office full of dead flies, except for the dead flies. Silence may have been bliss but it was killing her. She suffered.

The modern day frustrations. Monotonous and plentiful. She had friends but were the kind who would get you lilacs but you dont know how to take care of lilacs and they die and then they ask you "Where are the lilacs?" And you say they died and their face tells you your face is dumb. Thats it, all she had were selfish flower people.

Really, she was done. She looked out at the city. Some buildings were legs tripping over eachother. Others meandering pebbles. Everyday she walked through crowds, so many faces. They werent faceless . They all had them but couldnt face them. So many dorks... And they never seemed to pay the price of humiluating themselves through habit! Or improved their stature or walked their dogs more YOU MORONS.

Everyday she stood in a subway trains while backs hugged her at rush hour. Walls hugged her at the water cooler. The elevator gave her a wet kiss on the 9th floor.

Everyday with the humidity in a gusto wind, the heat off the sidewalk, the cold biting her, munching her comfort on the way home. She was weather's dinner, just another shank. The sweet sweat the sauce. Lamb Shankily she daydreamed kicking the ass of everyday weather for a more stable climate. She would shove all her sweaters and flip flops in its face "ha!" She'd scream.

I mean it when I say she had it. And since you cant really unhave something, semantics got in the way too, so she was pissed. Properly pissed. Not improperly irritated.

But really, what could she do? She sat in front of her desk pushing paper after paper, occassionally pulling. The office was all a buzz with telephone rings, hellos and nice days. "Hurumph¨ she mumbled in a moan. Hurumph indeed. She stared mindlessly at her hands, her fingers, her nails, etc.




A reckless ganaching gnashing. She took the door apart with her bare everything. Pieces of wood and shrapnel and lead and barrier stormed into the room. The hinges were unhinged in many ways, shuddering.
"OH MY GOD" she screamed, and we all heard her. She swung open the closet doors and they gasped at her expansive wardrobe of plain clothes.
"COME TO MOMMA" she wailed, and a whale of clothes englufed her. She felt like Gepedo (from pinnocio) only more hopeless.

You have to understand how banal and plain this woman was. The joke was on her, everyday wearing a different shade of grey. Silent movies screamed at her wardrobe it was so hideous. But she was turning over a new leaf, burning down the forest and saving the amazon(s?) while hugging all the trees. Ripping, tearing and ruining her clothes, she sought style where there was none.




They burst and blew into the room like a bomb like a train like a typhoon, soon to blow more. The lighting was as dim as him and it was about to go out. "No time for words" she whispered. "What?" He said. He grabbed her by the ankles and threw her against the wall. She ricocheted off of it and landed on the bed. "What an -animal-" she thought. "If he were a koala hed bite my head off". As she said this pieces of plaster trickled down over her like pennies being poured over a very rich pour guy. "Youre such a brute" she mewed, teasing the concrete out of her bangs. He coughed a little and said "What?".

"Thats just a sexcuse!" She screamed.

He thought for a bit and he was done for the year.
