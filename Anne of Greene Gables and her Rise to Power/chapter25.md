CHAPTER XXV. Matthew Insists on Puffed Sleeves

Yes he loves em, that lark.

Anne was privy in the living room parading her friends around her to ominous music. Her friends were circling her courtesying, obviously so tired from their knees could hardly put out another squat. Anne was in the middle. She spun, her arms raised in the air, he head flung back with a fountain of demands streaming out of her.  A techno march danced in her head while dream after dream of her absolute monarchy came true in it.

Matthew Cutthroat was in pure shock. He could have cut his _own_ throat after seeing that. The girls were soon too turned to move, so they scurried clumsily away out of the house barely walking. Anne assured them they'll practice again tomorrow until they get "The Fairy Queen" down tight. Marilla's Gorilla shrunk in a corner and into his sweater like a Dracula snail as the girls.

Creepily, he watched the girls put on their bonnets, boots and outer corsets on while Anne simply patted down her dress. Matthew looked at the sack Anne wore and then back at the other girls. Then back at Anne. Then back at the other girls, then back at Anne. Like a spectre in the dark he studied them until they were out the door.

Something was off, and it came to Matthew while hacking on his pipe smoke with Marilla shaking her head in disgust...

The clothes! The other girls wore lace and fine cottons. Their pocket lint was balls of silk. Mrs. Plebb's only ever made Anne's dresses in one color, dirt.

~That one by the way is always on the test, if you're taking notes. The dirt dress question.~

Like the mill he worked with his hands, another mill ground non-creepy girls dress thoughts in his head. The other girls wore pink bows and came each day with all colors of the rainbow. Anne had a flower stapled to her dress.

Fashion areas as distant to him as Antartica. Also the sleeves! The other girls' were so puffy, like little white bread loaves draped around their arms. He'll buy her one, COME ON! Two days before christmas. He was ridiculously satisfied with his discovery, and soon after he conked out.

The next day he headed carmodying to the store. The Cutthroats usually only dealt with one stop shop William Blake's makes. But he wanted to get Anne something over a nickel, so he headed to the infamous S&L's Chic Boutique, where only the finest gabelers shopped.

ALAS! DISDAIN! Who behind the counter but a lovely blossomy woman. Matthew could barely keep up a conversation with the three people he knew. This would surely kill him.

She had a huge, drooping... Pompadour. Big, rolly polly eyes and a most extensive and bewildering, hmm.... Smile. Her name was Lucilla.

"What can I get you Mr. Plebb?" She said smacking down the table, then trying to rub the smack in. Bangles trinkled and chinkled audibly down her arms like music. Even her eyebrow tick seduced him.

"Jesus" Matthew whispered to himself. Yea good luck with this.

"Well?" She slammed her hands down again, like an interrogator. She snapped her jaw.

"Um..." he felt his face getting whiter and deader than usual, " Garden rakes? Sugar? Mulch? Mulchy sugar?"

"We only have mulchy sugar unfortunately, and a few weed wackers." She said, yawning. Another crazy old person at the Gables. "White or brown?"

Matthew tried really hard but couldn't resist, and spat out "BROWN" in a hurry.

"Take the barrel over there. It comes in barrels."

She counted out his change and soon he made off carrying the barrel bow legged, a weed wacker strapped to his back.

"I'm not even going to ask why you got us this, will I? Why did you get it?" Marilla befummled. "I can't make anything with this except a poor cobbler and his even poorer donut." She threw a scoop into the barrel in disgust.
