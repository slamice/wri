CHAPTER XXIII. Anne's Good Grief with an Affair to Honor

Griefly, it took all of Anne's courage to muster lasting a month after the emininent liniment cake incident. Its not that she didn't outlast the many other crazy incidents she caused, but it was only a matter of time before Anne strapped herself in for another stunt. She poured some skilled milk into a yarn closet. She piggieback rided a young oinker into a pond, hogging it all to herself. Anne practically dolled out affairs and incidents she was one of the most turned to fantasy of high school drama clubs across Canndania. But nothing could prepare anyone for the good grief Anne would dish out next.

Exactly one week after the famous tiddly manse widdly tea time incident, Diana Barry, the rest of the bears and the girls had a party. "Small and select," Anne told Marilla Plebb, "only all the girls in our class and their mild mannered servants are allowed."

They all sat chummly picking at eachother's hair, and nothing happened until they went to the Barry berry beer garden. They decided to cun their wits on a truth or dare. All the kids were doing it. Dares were the new hotness and some like it hot.

Carrie Dallone dared the bright Ruby Gills to dance a foxtrot around a pile of green caterpillars. Josie Pie dared Plain Jane to stomp around the house a few times on one leg without squenching a lurge. Obviously impossible, she cried in defeat, purging it all over the lawn. Around that time Anne knew these dares were reaching a new peak of lame in lamesville. It was time to get heavy. With the dares.

Anne narrowed her eyes. A few girls shuddered. "I dare you Josie Pie..." she pronounced very slowly, "to tight rope walk this fence." She pointed at the Barry family's pride and Joy, a dispenceful fence. Unfortunately for Anne Josie Pie was born on a fence and she slithered all over it. The girls laughed at Anne's dare because seriously this was not getting heavy with the dares.

Anne shrugged and tossed a braid each over her shoulders. "Fences are for peons. Daily. If you had the gaul and the bupkes, you'd climb the roof, hail a few marys and do a dance up there." Obviously no one had any of the gauls and never bupkissed anyone. Anne sunk into the grass smiling. The girls stared at her until the Pie spoke up, "then you do it. Bare yourself all over the Barry's roof" her pie hole screamed.

Anne's eyebrow raised. "Oh I sleep up there every other night. Done." Diana insisted Anne not go through with it, but Anne wasn't listening, because she hiked up her skirt and shoved a braid in each ear, heading towards the ladder up to the roof of the Barry's kitchen.

"I must do it!" Anne bellowed at the top of her lungs out of her goalmouth, "My honor is at stake! You know how great honor is! you can have my memoirs and Sun Tzu if I die Diana." Once up, she balanced herself on the slanted roof and put one foot forward at a time. She lasted one step until morbid reality catastrophied into her body. she tripped on nothing and slammed down onto the slanted roof, taking off all the shingles as she rolled off of it. The only sounds louder than the roof breaking in tatters was the sound of Anne's bones breaking like a pile of sticks shaken in a bag. The girls shrieked one at a time, then altogether in unison.

Anne luckily only tumbled into the Barry's stash spare tumbleweed they kept for especially boring victorian moments. She splattered quite audibly and lied limply like a pile in a pile. All the girls rushed towards her and fell to their knees in a heap. Only the bright Ruby Gills was in agony and almost grieving over what kind of ghost Anne would come back to haunt her. Canadian ghouls were a bit common around then.

"Did you die?" Diana managed to whisper solemnly. Anne then sat up and mustered the simple condiment "I'm only unconscious."

Josie Pie and the rest of the catty girls wimpered in relief. "Do you feel any pain Anne?"

Anne popped both of her arms back in one at a time, but before Anne could mouth "my hair hurts" Mrs. Barry Mantelow came rushing in and fell in tune with their worried faces. Anne tried to claw herself away but a sharp pain slapped her ass down sister to listen up.

"Where does it hurt? Tell me." Diana's mother insisted.

"You could never dream where it hurts. Also my ankle. I can't Bare it. Please Diana, ask your dad to take me home in a gurney."

Marilla McPlebbers was out in the apple orchard eating when she heard the heavy wheels of a mobile stretcher drag on the path. On it was Anne, with Mr. Barrymore in front and Annes harem behind her all in a row, their faces as pale than skinned almonds.

At that moment Marilla had a revelation. She decided Anne was not a demon but some kind of wicked plotting person who only has bipolar, tripolar and possibly north polar problems. Seeing her limp and frowning made her realize she was a sucker for that sort of stuff. Dare she tell herself she loved Anne, and only wanted to hold her under her nape and fill her red red hair with tears.

"Drew what happened to Anne?"

But then Anne herself lifted her head, "Don't you see Marilla? My honor was on the line. No one likes a coward. I almost died."

"I thought you'd do something like that, festooning that party with your frat pranks-" But just then Anne fainted.

They told Marilla's gorilla, who was hunkering in the fields, to grab a doctor. And they soon found out Anne's ankle was broken with some deep teeth marks in it. Mrs. Plebb didn't really want to think about how that happened, because Anne was one weird kid.

Anne slipped into an ankle deep coma. Her dress was a see through white, a ghost dancing on rooftops that jovially smiled with their toothy thatches and panes. She hugged them tightly and laughed unapologetically. Everyone below her was presented as a peasant, brownly cloaked with dirt. A few ticks and lice fell out of them as she spoke. She denounced them all as peons. She peoned them hard, harder than any other peoning.

While she was asleep writhing with a grin about this stuff, teh doctors gave her a new pickled ankle and shoved it in Victorian style, pinkies up. They sent her home soon after.

That night Marilla went upstairs to her. Anne lied there unstable in the gable feeling pathetic.

"I hope you don't feel sorry for me." She said staring at the ceiling.

"You did this to yourself Anne. Why would you take that on? To walk across a roof and die?"

"What would you have done Marilla? That pie girl baked me a dare I couldn't refuse."

"I probably would have refused."

Anne sighed heavily, constantly misunderstood in a world that will never understand her stands. "The Pie would ruin me for the rest of my life. Any future campaigns would be botched with that record. And the ankle hurts and everyone was sad and that doctor Quinn was kind of creepy." She paused, then "Oh, I am an afflicted mortal." She said deadpanned.

"But isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination? It will help me through splendidly."

Over the course of the next few weeks everyday the queue of visitors came and left, and Anne couldn't shut up about them.

"Everyone has come to me, kind hearted." Anne said one day when she finally she could limp passionately across the floor. "There is a bright side to suffering, and it's when other people come to suffer with you." Even the kindred spirited superindent bellhop came to see me. I feel sorry I ever judged him. He told me about the time he broke his ankle as a boy. I never thought he ever was a boy though, and that he just hopped out of a womb with ankles. Even my imagination has its limits, for I can't imagine THAT. Even the pie girl came to visit me, and told me she would have started drinking a few years early if I would have died. Diana told me the new teacher Miss Stacy is rivaling me in sleeve puff size. She's stuffing her puffs I bet. I'll beat her though. Oh, it's just glorious to think of the many wonders of outside life."

"One thing is obvious Anne," Marilla said, mid porridge stir, but never finished her sentence.
