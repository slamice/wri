Chapter double X: The goodest imagination gone the wrongest

Oh my god Spring again in the gables, dangling like Canadian wedding cake from the top of the rafters. Hanging reluctant, hesistant to crash down on innocent faces. April and May were months and sisters dolling up chilly days and chillier sunsets bedazzling and destroying lives. The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded and pushed around against Dryad's Bubble butt. A bunch of boyish girls and girlish boys carried around flowers like confetti. They threw their arms up in the air and it flew every which way.
