Chapter 16. Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results

A seasonal shift to... Fall. Autumn. Harvest. Anne herself stared the summer sun down and now collected the foliage, the trees fallen yellow tears shed from the weather's mirth to the earth.
Anne raked what she thought could fashion some kind of color into her dreary dull brown room. And who know? "You can never be too prepared, chomping down on a maple isn't so bad as being hungry." she heard herself saying. Compost or dinner roast, she carried some dry gold mulch in large black bags, kicking the other few back home.

Mrs. Pleb was preparing for an outing, bonnet in a bow. Anne barged in with garbage, sweating and heaving. She looked like a hermit carrying her house.

"Um, ok..." Marilla Plebb sighed.

"I'm going to invent some dry wall with these. It's gonna be a regular thrill whirl." She could hear a voice say under the bags. "Dream a little."

Marilla obviously was blind to fashion or any aesthetic sense besides simply wearing clothes. Her wardrobe was a shrewd brownish black and hack. "Just don't make a mess. I'm going to aid my fellow Aid workers at Carmody today, and I'll be pretty late. You'll have to give Matthew and Jerry their supper. And don't forget to let the tea steep."

"Don't worry about the steeping. Last time that happened I told Matthew a story about a huge brawl between some mythological royals. He got so riled up he was drinking hot water straight from the spout."

"Yes, Matthew does that often. It's one of his few thrills. I don't know if this is a good idea, lest you get seriously or dreadfully addlepated, but I guess you can invite over Diana."

Wild thoughts danced in Anne's brain. Tea, the drink of Queens and Kings, sipped with luxury. It was one step closer to a madhouse of royalty. "That sounds absolutely exuberant. Can I use the rosebud tea set?"

"NO!" Marilla shrieked, "DON'T DO THAT. That tea set is fragile and only used for the aids workers and the prime minister. You can bring out the cookies, some fruit cake, the cherry preserves, etc. etc. Don't lay her hat in the laying room or the parlour with teh wrench and professor plum. Sit in the SITTING ROOM ONLY, ACCORDINGLY, you can have some cordial rasberry juice we broke open at the church rehearsal on the second shelf to the right of the yellow jar on top of the pantry by the left side, blah blah infinity"

Anne barely got the gist, she was still too gone in wet tea thoughts, pinkies out, her mouth stretching back and forth practicing sipping jovially. Marilla ignored its squinching. Squinch squinch.

"Matthew will be back late for tea, he's filling the potatoes into the velodrome." and with that Mrs. Pleb plebbed out the door.

At that moment Anne sharooshed down to the hollow in a gust of wind. Past Dryad's bubble, Humble man's tackleberry, the Hankerin' Inn and Mummblecrust alleyway. She invited Diana over primly proper, and the two soon enough met at Anne's door, both in not their first but second best dresses twice removed. They shook hands and bumped butts then entered promptly primperly, as quiet as if they were both deaf. Diana's hat off, they sat ten minutes in silence hardening into their roles as either upper crust whities or sedated fidgety Charlie Chaplins.

"How is your mother?" Asked Anne, knowing she was just fine because she saw her, like, 20 minutes ago.

"The potatoes crops are great this year since we bought a new dibbler, yours?"

"The apples are practically falling off the trees this season, aren't they?"

"We're invited to pick all of ours in the yard, the bright red ones. The read sweetlings. She's a red sweetling, so kind. Marilla said we can have all kinds of cakes, fruit, condiments, Hors dovers, etc. She also said we can have a special something to drink. It's rude to say what it is, but it starts with an R and a C and ends in ordial and berry like and it's bright red. A nice thick red. Don't you just love red liquids, they taste so much greater than other colors. Red poured, red sipped, red spilled..." Anne coughed and had to fight back the gush of froth from her mouth before she lost herself in another dream of battle.

The children attacked the apple tree all afternoon, finding a patch of green the frost was disappointed by. The fall sun shined down on them hard, and they basked in it with conversation.

Diana explained that in school she had to deal with Herty Gertie Pie, a wicked girl who somehow made her pencil squeek with anguish, almost pornifying it. Anotehr girl named Ruby Gills, a run of the mill Gills girl, lost all her Gill warts as a result of some drama stewed up by Ol' Mary Joe Jane with a magic stone. So much went down with Mamie, Mr. Syphilis, Sam the Boulder, Mrs. white with the candlestick, and Gilbert-.

Anne was slowly tiring of peasant fodder, so she asked if they wanted any sort of refreshing beverages like a lady would like some refreshments. "Let's get fresh" she jumped up.

Anne grabbed the first red bottle off the shelf, and smacked it on a tray. it tumbled over and over significantly as she brought it in.

Anne was stuffed, so Diana poured out a glug for herself in a dibbler and took a swig, wetting her stickybeak as she spoke.

"Wow this raspberry is cordially rasmatas. Where did you get this?"

Anne was stirring up the fire at this point, it started doggily but was now blazing under a pot. "Oh you like it?"

Diana was pouring out a second glass, "I think Marilla really has a natch for this. This is the nicest I ever drank. So kind and subtle. This is better than Mrs. Lindt's."

"I would think it is. Mrs. Plebb is an infamous cook, cooking up all kinds of mad concoctions. She's trying to teach me but there are so many rules and nothing is natural. The fight is always in a bowl. You have to stir and whisp and stir and taper."

"I even ruined a cake because I was writing our future memoir. You were dying of a deflty horrible disease, smallpox. Covered in it whithering in disgust, all pocky and poxy. Everyone evacuated the village but I resurected you from a a near dead state. I threw the cake in the oven and little did I know there's flour in a cake. What do I know about cakes anyway? There are flourless cakes though. So I had an excuse but no carob. So it didn't work."

Diana started to listen dreamily, her cheek rested on her palm holding up her head, her eyes drooping like a wet sock on a hamper.

"I made pudding too, but Mrs. Plebdom was very cross with me after that. I double checked it was plum pudding, not blood pudding. She made it and some was left over, but I started up our future memoir again. I was a Cathaholic Protestant, the situation was complicated, taking teh viel to bury a broken heart in a cloister, and I didn't cover the pudding because that is important."

"So the next morning I find a mouse ate itself to death in a passionate feast in the pudding. I'm freaking out, I take out the mouse with a spoon, it burps up some plumage, etc."

Diana starts laughing as if making fun of her own laughing, "Ya ha ya haha ya ya".

"Marilla was outside, milking away, and I knew there was some sure shitfire about to break up this house. But I completely forgot about the pudding because I was invested in my own imagination, divining different colors for flowers, making them dance on their petals for me. In come the Chesterfields for dinner, top hats, canes, monocoles, the whole dish. Marilla breaks out the plum sauce and I scream 'NO, MICE WERE IN THAT..."

"Mrs. Chesterfield stared at me and I had to yell in pure shock 'IT WAS TOO GOOD, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO'. Mrs. Plebb couldn't believe the circumstances, so she brought out some strawberry preserves and we went through the whole punishment rigamarole..."

Diana was definitely not listening. Anne was talking a mile a minute, her mouth a motor of petty homelife while Diana was in another world, flailing like some sort of sexular humanizm,  before hanging from the rafters. She went around the room, roundy roundy roundy.

She smacked out thickly like a heavily drugged Dorothy Gale, "I must go home". Looking for an exit, she began flopknopin' all over the floor. A pure lightweight.

Anne was confused, obviously. Could the raspberry coridially ferment in a few moments before serving it? She started offering up all kinds of substitutes.

"Wouldn't you like some Tea like a proper royal? Fruit cake? Bundt cake? Wild Clodhoppers? Maybe a hair of the dog?"

"The room is reeling unreally, I'm so dizzy"

This would surely be the talk of the town, painting the Gables a blackish hue with rumors raging about Anne's improperly behaved behaviors. That chocolate witch Lindt would cut the throats of the Cutthroats with what Anne bumbled this time.

Anne walked Diana to the second stump beypond the Barry's gate into town. Diana started crying tears of mirth. Her 2nd best dress moved down the ranks as the snotspots started appear while thick wet plumage luged out of her nose.

Anne wasn't in the habit of making people uproariously drunk by accident. She didn't make a deal of it except it killed her inside not to be perfect in front of these Plebbs, so she made Marilla's gorilla Matthew and Jerry some tea and offted to bed.
