Chapter 16. Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results

Fall. Autumn. Harvest. Anne herself stared the summer sun down and now collected the foliage, the trees fallen yellow tears shed from the weather's mirth to the earth.
Anne raked what she thought could fashion some kind of color into her dreary dull brown room. And who know? "You can never be too prepared, chomping down on a maple isn't so bad as being hungry." she heard herself saying. Compost or dinner roast, she carried some dry gold mulch in large black bags, kicking the other few back home.

Mrs. Pleb was preparing for an outing, bonnet in a bow. Anne barged in with garbage, sweating and heaving. She looked like a hermit carrying her house.

"Um, ok..." Marilla Plebb sighed.

"I'm going to invent some dry wall with these. It's gonna be a regular thrill whirl." She could hear a voice say under the bags. "Dream a little."

Marilla obviously was blind to fashion or any aesthetic sense besides simply wearing clothes. Her wardrobe was a shrewd brownish black and hack. "Just don't make a mess. I'm going to aid my fellow Aid workers at Carmody today, and I'll be pretty late. You'll have to give Matthew and Jerry their supper. And don't forget to let the tea steep."

"Don't worry about the steeping. Last time that happened I told Matthew a story about a huge brawl between some mythological royals. He got so riled up he was drinking hot water straight from the spout."

"Yes, Matthew does that often. It's one of his few thrills. I don't know if this is a good idea, lest you get seriously or dreadfully addlepated, but I guess you can invite over Diana."

Wild thoughts danced in Anne's brain. Tea, the drink of Queens and Kings, sipped with luxury. It was one step closer to a madhouse of royalty. "That sounds absolutely exuberant. Can I use the rosebud tea set?"

"NO!" Marilla shrieked, "DON'T DO THAT. That tea set is fragile and only used for the aids workers and the prime minister. You can bring out the cookies, some fruit cake, the cherry preserves, etc. etc. Don't lay her hat in the laying room or the parlour with teh wrench and professor plum. Sit in the SITTING ROOM ONLY, ACCORDINGLY, you can have some cordial rasberry juice we broke open at the church rehearsal on the second shelf to the right of the yellow jar on top of the pantry by the left side, blah blah infinity"

Anne barely got the gist, she was still too gone in wet tea thoughts, pinkies out, her mouth stretching back and forth practicing sipping jovially. Marilla ignored its squinching. Squinch squinch.

"Matthew will be back late for tea, he's filling the potatoes into the velodrome." and with that Mrs. Pleb plebbed out the door.

At that moment Anne sharooshed down to the hollow in a gust of wind. Past Dryad's bubble, Humble man's tackleberry, the clodhopper Inn and Mummblecrust alleyway. She invited Diana over primly proper, and the two soon enough met at Anne's door, both in not their first but second best dresses twice removed. They shook hands and bumped butts then entered promptly primperly, as quiet as if they were both deaf. Diana's hat off, they sat ten minutes in silence hardening into their roles as either upper crust whities or sedated fidgety Charlie Chaplins.

"How is your mother?" Asked Anne, knowing she was just fine because she saw her, like, 20 minutes ago.

"The potatoes crops are great this year, yours?"

"The apples are practically falling off the trees this season, aren't they?"

"We're invited to pick all of ours in the yard, the bright red ones. The read sweetlings. She's a red sweetling, so kind. Marilla said we can have all kinds of cakes, fruit, condiments, Hors dovers, etc. She also said we can have a special something to drink. It's rude to say what it is, but it starts with an R and a C and ends in ordial and berry like and it's bright red. A nice thick red. Don't you just love red liquids, they taste so much greater than other colors. Red poured, red sipped, red spilled..." Anne had to fight back the gush of froth from her mouth before she lost herself in another dream of battle.





She wetted her stickybeak

She flailed like some sort of sexular humanizm, flopknopin' all over the floor before hanging from the rafters.
