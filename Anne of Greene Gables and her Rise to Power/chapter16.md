Chapter 16. Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results

Anne herself stared the summer sun down and now collected the rotting foliage, the trees fallen yellow tears shed from the weather's mirth to the earth. The Fall began, one Anne lest best forget.

Anne raked what she thought could fashion some kind of color into her dreary dull brown room. And who knows? "You can never be too prepared, chomping down on a maple isn't so bad as being hungry." she heard herself saying. Compost or dinner roast, she carried some dry gold mulch in large black bags, kicking the other few back home.

Mrs. Pleb was preparing for an outing, bonnet in a bow. Anne barged in with the garbage, sweating and heaving. She looked like a hermit carrying her house.

"Um, ok..." Marilla Plebb sighed.

"I'm going to invent some dry wall with these. It's gonna be a regular thrill whirl. So many thrills here." She could hear a voice say under the bags. "Dream a little."

Marilla obviously was blind to fashion or any aesthetic sense besides simply wearing clothes. Her wardrobe was a shrewd brownish black and hack. "Just don't make a mess. I'm going to aid my fellow Camrodery of Aid workers at Carmody today, and I'll be pretty late. You'll have to give Matthew and Jerry their supper. And don't forget to let the tea steep."

"Don't worry about the steeping. Last time that happened I told Matthew a story about a huge brawl between some mythological royals. He got so riled up he was drinking hot water straight from the spout."

"Ah that must have been one of few ~thrills~. Anne, I don't know if this is a good idea, lest you get seriously or dreadfully addlepated, but I guess you can invite over Diana."

Wild thoughts danced foxtrots in Anne's brain. Tea, the drink of Queens and Kings, British Peons, etc. sipped with luxury. It was finally one step closer to autocratic results. An escape. "That sounds absolutely exuberant. Can I use the rosebud tea set?"

"NO!" Marilla shrieked, "DON'T DO THAT. That tea set is fragile and only used for the aids workers and prime ministers. You can bring out the cookies, some fruit cake, the cherry preserves, coffee shop embelishments. Don't lay her hat in the laying room or you in the parlor with the wrench. Sit in the SITTING ROOM ONLY, ACCORDINGLY and CORESSPONDINGLY you can have some cordial raspberry we broke open at the church rehearsal on the second shelf to the right of the yellow jar on top of the pantry by the left side, blah blah infinity"

Anne barely got the gist, she was still too gone in wet tea thoughts, pinkies hooked out, her mouth stretching back and forth practicing sipping jovially. Back and forth in a yum-a-lum motion. Marilla ignored this but couldn't help squinching. Squinch squinch.

"Matthew will be back late for tea, he's filling the potatoes into the velodrome." and with that Mrs. Pleb plebbed out the door, hairnet and all.

At that moment Anne flew down out of the house, _SHAROOSH_, to the hollow in a gust of wind. Past Dryad's bubble, Humble man's tackleberry, the Hankerin' Inn and Mummblecrust alleyway, the 'round horsefeather shop. She invited Diana over primly proper, and the two soon enough met at Anne's door, both in not their first but second best dresses twice removed. They shook hands and bumped butts then entered promptly, _PRIMPERLY_, as quiet as if they were both deaf. Diana's hat off, they sat ten minutes in silence hardening into their roles as either upper crust whities or sedated fidgety Charlie Chaplins.

"How is your mother?" Asked Anne, knowing she was just fine because she saw her, like, 20 minutes ago.

"The potatoes crops are great this year since we bought a new dibbler, yours?"

"The apples are practically falling off the trees this season, aren't they?"

"We're invited to pick all of ours in the yard, the bright red ones. The red sweetlings. Marilla said so. She's a red sweetling, so kind." Anne said "Marilla said we can have all kinds of cakes, fruit, condiments, Hors dovers, etc. She also said we can have a special something to drink. It's rude to say what it is, but it starts with an R and a C and ends in ordial and berry like and it's bright red. A nice thick red. Don't you just love red liquids, they taste so much greater than other colors. Red poured, red sipped, red spilled..." Anne coughed and had to fight back the gush of froth from her mouth before she lost herself in another dream of blood soaked battles.

The children attacked the apple tree all afternoon, taking dogslice after dogslice of Grannysmiths, red deliciouses, honey crisps, craby apples, Antonovka's. They found a patch of green the frost was disappointed by and parked their bums there. The fall sun shoned down on them hard, and they basked in it with conversation.

Anne and Diana, neither are perfect. Being broken pre-millenial bratty teenagers in need of spilling and release the unfolding soap operas of their lives from their heaving chests just like us all. I've already highlighted the more important parts, so please take your cliff notes and shred them with a cheese grater, because those pages would be your eyes if you had to read the mobius strip of drama add ad nauseam.

Diana explained that in school she had to deal with Herty Gertie Pie, a wicked girl who somehow made her pencil squeek with anguish, almost pornifying it. Another girl named Ruby Gills, a run of the mill Gills girl, lost all her Gill warts as a result of some drama stewed up by Ol' Mary Joe Jane with a magic stone. So much went down with Mamie, Mr. Syphilis, Sam the Boulder, Mrs. White with the candlestick, and Gilbert-Godfried.

Anne was slowly tiring of peasant fodder, so she asked if they wanted any sort of awesome dusty beverages like a lady would like some. "Let's get fresh" she jumped up.

Anne grabbed the first red bottle off a shelf, and smacked it on a tray. it tumbled over and over significantly as she brought it in.

Anne was stuffed with apple guts, so Diana poured out a few glugs for herself in a dibbler and took a swig, wetting her stickybeak as she spoke.

"Wow this raspberry is cordially superb. Where did you get this?"

Anne was stirring up the fire at this point, it started doggily but was now blazing under a pot. "Oh you like it?"

Diana was pouring out a second glass, "I think Marilla really has a natch for this. This is the nicest I ever drank. So kind and subtle. The form! This is better than Mrs. Lindt's."

"I would think it is. Mrs. Plebb is an infamous cook, cooking up all kinds of mad concoctions. She's trying to teach me but there are so many rules and nothing is natural. How could I possibly learn such commonalities? The fight is always in a bowl. You have to stir and whisp and stir and taper."

"I even ruined a cake because I was writing our future memoir. You were dying of a few deftly horrible diseases. Covered in them whithering in disgust, all pocky and poxy. Everyone evacuated the village but I ressurrected you from a a near dead state. I threw the cake in the oven and little did I know there's flour in a cake. What do I know about cakes anyway? There are flourless cakes though. So I had an excuse so I put that in there too, but it didn't work."

Diana started to listen dreamily, her cheek rested on her palm holding up her heavy head, her eyes drooping like wet socks on a hamper.

"I made pudding too, but Mrs. Plebbdom was very cross with me after that. Hailing Mary after cab after Mary. I double checked it was plum pudding, not blood pudding. She made it and some was left over, but I started up our future memoir again. I was a Cathaholic Protestant, the situation was complicated, taking a veil to bury a purple broken heart in a cloister, and I didn't cover the pudding because what I was doing is _important_."

"So the next morning I find a mouse ate itself to death in a passionate illustrious grubby feast in the pudding. I'm freaking out, I take out the mouse with a spoon, completely purpurated, it burps up some plumage (plum-age), etc."

Diana starts laughing as if making fun of her own laughing, "Ya ha ya haha ya ya".

"Marilla was outside, milking away, and I knew there was some sure shitfire about to break up this house. But I completely forgot about the pudding because I was invested in my own imagination, divining different colors for flowers, making them dance on their petals for me. In come the Chesterfields for dinner, top hats, canes, monocoles, the whole dish. Marilla breaks out the plum sauce and I scream 'NO, MICE WERE IN THAT..."

"Mrs. Chesterfield stared at me and I had to yell in pure shock 'IT WAS TOO GOOD' Mrs. Plebb couldn't believe the circumstances, so she brought out some strawberry preserves and we went through the whole punishment rigamarole..."

Diana was _definitely_ not listening. Anne's mouth was a motor serving out petty homelife while Diana was in another world, up now and flailing like some sort of sexular humanizm. Then, hanging from the rafters rowing around the room, she almost sang her burps.

She smacked out thickly like a heavily drugged Dorothy Gale, "I must go home". Looking for an exit, she began flopknopin' all over the floor. A pure lightweight, Anne thought.

Anne was confused, obviously. Could the raspberry cordially ferment in a few moments before serving it? She started offering up all kinds of substitutes.

"Wouldn't you like some Tea like a proper? Fruit cake? Bundt cake? Wild Meatus? Clodhoppers?"

"The room is reeling unreally, I'm so dizzy"

This would surely be the talk of the town, painting the Gables a blackish hue with rumors raging about Anne's improperly behaved behaviors. That chocolate witch Lindt would slash the throats of the Cutthroats with what Anne bumbled this time.

Anne walked Diana to the second stump beyond the gassy knoll into town, past Charlie's barbershop and Yonker's grampy wash to Diana Barrymore's gate. Diana started crying tears of mirth. Her 2nd best dress moved down the ranks as the snotspots started appearing, thick wet clods luged out of her nose.

Anne got home. She wasn't in the habit of making people uproariously drunk by accident. She didn't make a deal of it except it killed her inside not to be perfect in front of these Plebbs, so she made Marilla's gorilla Matthew and that guy Jerry some tea and offted to bed.

The days dragged on. Anne worried about Diana day and night like a lost dog only she was a drunk girl. On a Monday errand to the chocolate witch Anne bombastically broke down her home door on return and lied sobbing in heap.

"Anne, have you been saucing up Mrs. Lindt again Meltily?"

She loses it. _It is gone_. Anne simply sobbed away ocean after ocean of tears crying tinier tears. The whole mood in the house dampened. No doubt a few more mice will be ignored tonight in the various array of puddings and pies Marilla made in Anne's soggy ignorance.

Anne sat up, tragedy personified.

"Mrs. Lindt was up to see Mrs. Barrymore today and Mrs. Barrymore was out swinging fists in rage. She said I drove Diana drunk and she had to attend multiple double and triple A groups because her health and driving has gotten so bad. I've driven my best friend I was to cure, to bury with my own hands... To madness."

Mrs. Plebb knew Anne was a monster in her own right and wasn't privy to shivy a drink or two unto an unsuspecting few. But, "What on earth did you give her?" She demanded.

"I gave her various delectable pleasures. Among them your cordial raspberries" Anne, sounding so wrong she was sure she was right. Her face was just a wet waterfull now, salt crystals forming under her eyes. "I never thought such a harmless drink could turn people into mislead guttiwuts."

Marilla cringed a small plebb.

"I must have driven Mrs. Thomas mad too. The devil in the red, red berries." and Anne proceeded to cross herself several times.

"Set her drunk?!" Mrs. P marched her a in the drinking room, and noticed the currant gutrot she brewed illegally  years ago was drunk prohibitedly, hardly cordial at all! She Remembered Mrs. Barrymore or less cared for the wine, calling it a drunk's sneeze. She remembered she deceived Anne by accident this time, putting away the raspberry juice in the cellar.

"Anne, you certainly have a knack for getting yourself in trouble. You substituted currant wine instead of raspberry. You miscarried and misconceived this whole situation."

This seems a low point for Anne, and it is. Anne is firmly squeezed into a childhood she doesn't belong in, and she's grasping her way out.

"I didn't mean so, not at all. I was being a hospitable host. Mrs. Barrymore said she smelled the drink on her daughters breathe as she laughed and feel to her feet in a heap, sleeping for hours, her face turning various rainbow colors, hopefully not heaving. She has no room in her heart for gurgitating animals, only for vengeance."

"Well, for Diana to drink so much pays a hefty price. There goes the neighborhood. The islanders will get their kick our of this, people won't like my wine anymore."

Not that they did anyway, Mrs. Pleb?

"You shouldn't be blamed for this Anne."

"We are torn apart, Diana and I. I never dreamt of this when we swore our vows of friendship." Anne thought hard about how Diana wouldn't be up to getting cured by her by any new diseases coming up in the next century, let alone take a position in her office as some kind of bishop lady. Brought to her knees by a conniving drink con.

Mrs. Pleb asked of Anne to present the Barrymores with a firm situation analysis, lest she think it was a cruel Anne ploy as was typical. And perhaps take a bit more of the curious currant, to top off a hangover with some hair of the dog. But the doghairs, Anne knew, were furilly frayed, and Marilla knew as well. So Mrs. Pleb firmed up to go and explain the situation, but came back in a hurry empty handed, in horror, her hat on wrong.

"What is wrong with that woman. We get her daughter drunk and she's all IN, a quite unnecessary, HITHER. I told her to beat her kid for drinking so much and she got madder." At that Anne heard the smacking of facepalms from around the world.

Anne took it upon herself to talk to the Barrymores more. Anne regained her literary sanity, and marched down past the old log, the old barkeep Inn, pate's pawnshop, David the horn's sprucey grove, etc. under a light moon smiling down on her, _believing_ in her.

She knocked on the door and out appeared a Diana mom, Mrs. Barrymore White singing the tune of wicked and solitude. Her frontal look hardened like a chiseled rock, rocking prejudices and dislikes, borrowing a few from some neighbors just to keep them going strong. her daughter was contaminated and she had to believe there was an assailant. She was the type of person who created a few lies for herself to believe every few weeks just to get through all the truths.

"What do _you_ want?"

Anne finally sobered herself up and shed her childlike tendencies and thought it all pathetic. These people! God. The Edward islanders steeped in their own problems like the very teas they drink. A raspberry soup with stray hairs and specks floating in it. But she will never waver.

"Give me a fricking break lady. What kind of lip service do you want from me? I gave her a corker... And? My other friends are pathetic compared to Diana. Their all in her shadow and stuff. In fact there are none. Geez, Louise."

Mrs. Barrymore's rock face somehow conjugated into Titanium. "Geez... Diana?" She tried to correct her, "You can no longer see her. She's gone with her father carmodying somewhere. You aren't fit to associate with Diana anymore. She is no longer your associate. That is a FIRM. FIRM DISASSOCIATIONING!" Mrs. B grabbed the door and slammed it, a few splinters sprayed and dug into Anne's nose. She walked distraught and carefully back to the Gables, the greenery hueing in sadness.

"What is this world" the thought in her mind, "What makes you fail, what makes you grow?" She stared at her hands as she walked up stairs, and told Mrs. Plebbers as she walked back in "I do not believe that God himself can untie that woman's tied, obstinate heart."

Anne was so dismayed that she underestimated Mrs. Plebb's foolishness, Diana's sanity and Barrymore's one less of a berry too many her raspberry of anger. Did she know people at all?

Marilla found her asleep that night, face down in a tear soaked pillow that she surely would have drowned from except the bed had many holes from Matthew the Gorilla's pure insulted carpentry. The bed holes drained the tears through.

She turned Anne over, let a cloth soak on her face for an hour, brushed her curls from her face and then gave her a tummy tuck into the sheets. Anne dreamt wicked dreams, with tears that weren't hers.
