Chapterly 15, Imagine. Drunk on Tea.

"What a splendid day!" said Anne, drawing a long heaving breath. "Isn't it good just to be alive on a day like this? I pity the unborn people for missing it. They may have good nonexistent days, of course, but this one, damn. I's all ours! It just gets splendider and splendider."

"Am I missing tarts? How many bites for the ten of us" The ugliest confused glance came over Anne's walking stick, Diana, as she tried to count how many tarts she was missing. More than you know Diana, more than you know.

Since Canadians overfeed their geese, the school girls had to ration their food regularly. If one girl didn't reveal her rations she was chastized and forced to sing the OCanada. Everyone was hungry and yet, with all irony in hand, no one was invited to lunch.

Anne and her butty whiskered through Bum Lane, Violet's Quesy and Ottenbacher's Pale Bare Road. SO much more satisfying then going down main street, a mild street for the mains of wherever they lived exactly.

Bum Lane parted into two different firm round roads, one that ended at the Cutthroat's doorstep. Anne called it Lover's lane because it had more bushes to hid behind to do nasty things. She named it months before she even got to the Gables.

"I like that lane. You can think out loud without people calling you crazy." It stopped no one.

Anne started out in the morning bright and tight. By belch's brook she met up with Diana to mazel tov, eat a bouzouki and then headed over the rustic artisanal bread bridge. They left the lane, waded through fondle pond and onto Violet Femmes Vale. Violets propelled by heavy winds pummeled them in the face.

Sooner or later they passed by Birch stump, a stump of birch. Anne recalled "Diana named it Birch stump. She wanted to, so I let her; but I'm sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch stump. Like Birth stump. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch stump is one of the prettiest places in the world, Marilla."

Flowers and blossoms gleamed and beamed at each other. The area was so thick with beauty the girls had to hold breaths and take turns looking at it. They swallowed and exhaled heavily as they walked heaving in ferns and starflowers and gurdled yearkin berries. Scarlet tufts and whisps of something or other hit their shoes unabashed. Birds were chaotically chirping their lungs' viscous liquidities out and the woods laughed heavy natural chuckles.

150 kilometers later they arrived at school. The dark white school house, like so many other houses at the Gabe, was silouheted on a hill like an ominous sign of education. A tiny path went up to it. Generations of school children, from cave times and beyond, etched in their initials, hieroglyphicals and lists of pokemon they owned. The stories these elder children would have taught them would have been one hundred times better than the drab mathematical gibberish of green hilltop life every substitute teacher spouted.

Marilla shuddered just thinking about Anne in school. Marilla kanew all the complaints. Anne talked too much. Anne was privy with disrespect. Anne kind of looked like Archie Andrews. Anne drank from the teapot spouts. Anne brandished an assault rifle. The list went on and on like a recipe for a King Henry dinner.

"I think I'm going to like school here, there's so much drama." Anne announced, dancing around the room in an unruly foxtrot. "The headmaster is flirting with Prissy Girl. Tile Boulder told the ruby gills fish girl that Prissy is going to Queen's college soon. But headmaster Blurburson would no sooner die. He went in to the outhouse and afterwards we saw markings etched all over. 'I love you, you are the Prissiest.' and 'I'm gafawked by your extra curricular talents.'"

Marilla's face smudged "Don't talk about the school principal that way Anne. Whether he's perverting or curmudgeoning it's none of your business."

"Diana and I sit together strategically in the middle of al the students. To our left flank is the window bearing shining water lake. The school girls are interesting creatures Marilla. Their imaginations are daft and not up to imagination snuff. And Mr. Philips, Oh! He is the rudest prudest man. His imagination is disgustingly tame. Like a dog, whimpering like a pathetic thought bubble. Imagine that!" a pause, and then "IRONIC!" an eccentric Anne screamed.

"It wasn't as hard as _you'd_ imagine! I'll school them there. At the school!"

Three weeks went by and more of the same. On a crisp September morning Diana and Anne trogged down the aforementioned paths. "Gilbert godfried is coming back, I saw it on facebook." Diana smiled a guile of a smile. Maybe Godfriend was a charmer, and perhaps we'll see more of this Godly friend than we could ever imagine. "I heard he does multiplications using freckles."

"Outdated!" Anne shouted. "I saw his name on the take notice wall at the school by the furniture ads. Take notice. Boy. A friendly god boy. I barely noticed it!" As Anne ripped through Cattails and violet stalks with a machette.

"Those notices are nothing. Girls and boys like each other so they write them up on the board." Diana remembered her name written in cursive once, and she blushed on top of a blush. "You'll be written up as being smart soon enough, by Charlie Sloane. He told his mom about you, and you know what that means. His mom knows."

Anne, Feminine to the very core, feminized. "He should print my name like a Warhol piece. He's got goggle eyes. What does that even look like!"

"Gilbert's been away ever since his whole family got sick of New Brunswick. The lobsters done almost done them in. He's ill read now. Not much better than Gertie Pie or any of her other half baked brothers and sisters"

Later, in class, while Latin was boring the children, Diana signaled to Anne where the God son sat. He was across from here, a no good nick at night, tying the girl in front of him's pony tail into a makeshift pulley system. He was tall, at least the length of two arm stretches and a half in Canadian meters, hair a brawny brown, and a twisted smile mouth like a decomposing jack o lantern's mouth.

Suddenly, the slapstick spouts were turned on and flowed heavily.

While Anne dreamt in a few dazes about conquering avoveloa or whatever, she was suddenly jolted awake with Gilbert Godfried whispering in a high pitched yelling voice trying to distract her "carrots! carrots!" He said with his annoying face.

Anne looked at him with vengence! "I hate carrots!" she yelled at the top of her lungs. She slammed her slate down onto Gilbert's head and cracked both, the slate and the head, in two.

Oh man, Mr. Philips was closing in on them both, Latin slurs authoratatively spewing every which way.

"What the dickens is dicking around over here?" Mr. philips eyes darted every which way looking for an explanation. Godfried, his high pitched moaning overtly audible, a head where the top was now a crown of blood, moaned annoyingly.

Typically Anne prefered physical punishment punches. But Mr. Philips had a mind didn't work that way, and since he had to save both his arms for flirting, marched Anne to the corner to suffer humiliation.

"I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe," said Anne gerfumpled, walking home with Diana. "And Mr. Phillips spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered into my soul, Diana."

For further humiliation, Anne was sat next to the piercing shrill boy. "Sit next to him." Mr. philips shouted, "The finest buddy of the lord, Gilbert Godfriend".

"Obey me at once." he yelled again.

It was bad enough to be singled out for punishment the constant guilt of simply being a child; it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable.

But Anne didn't even care. Her whole being was so soaked with anger and humiliation, she wring out her clothes out to death on the shrilly squaking staring Godfried.

At the end of the day Anne packed up all her quills and sharpeners, parephenalia and mess of junk.

"Where are you taking all of your stuff?" moaned Diana.

"Diana, I'm never coming back here."

"For good? leaving school forever? leaving me?" Diana's eyes trembled. A jet of tears was ready to be shot out and spray all over Anne's petticoat.

"I am not coming back to school any more," said Anne. "I'd do almost anything in the world for you, Diana," said Anne sadly. "I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I can't do this, so please don't ask it. You harrow up my very soul."

"But we're going to play ball next week! You've never even seen a ball."

"Nor do I care how to play it. Ball."

-------------------------------------------------

Nothing moved Anne in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go to school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.

"Nonsense," said Marilla.

"It isn't nonsense at all," said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn, reproachful eyes. "Don't you understand, Marilla? I've been insulted."

"Insulted fiddlesticks! You'll go to school tomorrow as usual."

"Oh, no." Anne shook her head gently. "I'm not going back, Marilla. "I'll learn my lessons at home and I'll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it's possible at all. But I will not go back to school, I assure you."

Marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of Anne's small face. She understood that she would have trouble in overcoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then. "I'll run down and see Rachel about it this evening," she thought. "There's no use reasoning with Anne now. She's too worked up and I've an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can make out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a rather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I'll just talk it over with Rachel. She's sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it. She'll have heard the whole story, too, by this time."

Marilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as usual.

"I suppose you know what I've come about," she said, a little shamefacedly.

Mrs. Rachel nodded.

"About Anne's fuss in school, I reckon," she said. "Tillie Boulter was in on her way home from school and told me about it." "I don't know what to do with her," said Marilla. "She declares she won't go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I've been expecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were going too smooth to last. She's so high strung. What would you advise, Rachel?"

"Well, since you've asked my advice, Marilla," said Mrs. Lynde amiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--"I'd just humor her a little at first, that's what I'd do. It's my belief that Mr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn't do to say so to the children, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who were late should have been punished as well as Anne, that's what. And I don't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It isn't modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne's part right through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular among them, somehow. I never thought she'd take with them so well."

"Then you really think I'd better let her stay home," said Marilla in amazement.

"Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her again until she said it herself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she'll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord, that's what, while, if you were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum she'd take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the better, in my opinion. She won't miss much by not going to school, as far as that goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The order he keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he's getting ready for Queen's. He'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle hadn't been a trustee--the trustee, for he just leads the other two around by the nose, that's what. I declare, I don't know what education in this Island is coming to."

Mrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the head of the educational system of the Province things would be much better managed.

Marilla took Mrs. Rachel's advice and not another word was said to Anne about going back to school. She learned her lessons at home, did her chores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights; but when she met Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him in Sunday school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his evident desire to appease her. Even Diana's efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail. Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert Blythe to the end of life.

As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes. One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight, crying bitterly.

"Whatever's the matter now, Anne?" she asked.

"It's about Diana," sobbed Anne luxuriously. "I love Diana so, Marilla. I cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up that Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall I do? I hate her husband--I just hate him furiously. I've been imagining it all out--the wedding and everything--Diana dressed in snowy garments, with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Diana goodbye-e-e--" Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing bitterness.

Marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no use; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted in amazement. When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?

"Well, Anne Shirley," said Marilla as soon as she could speak, "if you must borrow trouble, for pity's sake borrow it handier home. I should think you had an imagination, sure enough."
