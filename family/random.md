My Dad wanted the finer things in life but still wanted to save money. Five star hotels, swimming pools, the unlikely sort of things.

I think in his unwritten rules was one clause completely overwritten. One of his weaknesses was free samples. We'd be in malls, and the respective custodian would be offering candies, fruit, etc. Dad would, without shame or future regret, take one then two. Seven chocolates later, still standing by the custodian, he would show his eighth peice and pronounce "Chocolate!" before eating it.

 I was crying so much the snot was drooling all the way to the floor, likcin gthe ground collecting dirt.
