If you had to say he looked like one person, who would it be?

The person is a woman. Some other questions might arise: Does she have large or small breasts? Her waist?
Hips? Legs? How does she keep her nailsâ€”bitten to the bone, perfectly manicured, painted black, fake extensions? Does she have long eyelashes, does she use mascara? Makeup? Does she wear too much? Not enough? Is she naturally beautiful?

If you had to say she looked like one person, who would it be?

What details might you add that you may not have thought of previously?

Self analysis:

If you were to ask your character his analysis of himself, would there be any discrepancy? Denial? Does he think he's handsome even though objectively he's not?

Or, does he think he's ugly although he's good-looking?

Does he consider himself young although he's obviously well aged?

Does he think he's short although he's over six feet? Does she think she's heavy even though there's not an ounce of fat on her? What do any of these discrepancies say about the character? Do they point to any greater issue?
