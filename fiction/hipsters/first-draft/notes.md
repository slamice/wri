Notes per chapter:

1st: 

Who character is: Om is a Lebanese guy on a weird post graduate work visa.
What character wants: He wants to fit in and be relaxed, forgetting his former life and be at peace with himself.

Need to introduce Gala here for letter.

2nd:

Set up Renee dynamic

Important to meet Andrew and take letter from Prof to set ending punch. Set up Jack as an artist, will have a gallery showing eventually on his birthday (say when?)

3rd:

Phone call to set up Father vs. Son dynamic with Om and his Dad.

4th:

Find out Om is slipping in his job, set up cruise scenario.

Introduce Michael, someone Om _should_ be if he fits into the corporate world. A model for what he should be.

5th:

Go on a long walk without Renee, set up Renee dynamic.

1. Renee is a user, uses Om (maybe uses the indian "Om"?) as an excuse
2. Suspects holding citizenship over his head.

6th:

Party/show? Maybe meets Gala to give her letter?

7th:

Cruise... Invites Gala?

8th:

Another phone call to bring back Visa issue and mother

9th:










Setup:

- He's in this world, a slacker at work. The hipster world re-enforces his indifference.
He uses the visa as a goal and an excuse, but he has no power over the visa.

How Om changes:
- He realizes his gf is not something he cares about.
- His mother gives him something to care about.


**************

Ch1 & 2:

Wants to show he's a smart person, thoughtful.

- Comes off that he's boring, vain and . Start to show he's limiting himself in this world (e.g. by rejecting visiting back to his home because his visa was going through).
- Set up with later plot for Prof.

Themes:
- Changing mind from indifference and inaction to action
- Loneliness
- If you want something yuo need to be an active part of it
- Talk is cheap

Tour: A thing he sets to do but puts no effort towards, sabotaging himself and making it unacheivable.

Visa: A thing he has no control over but decides to live under because it's an excuse to stay, easier than to leave.

meditating: Useless without purpose

family: Enforce some sort of values

All people except family: re-enforce same lie to eachother

Prof:

Jack and Ryan: Echoes of indifference

Gabby:
















We recognize 









- Idea is Om digs his own grave.
- Mother's condition echoes his descent, moral element of story
