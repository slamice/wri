CHAPTER 4

Every other day I woke up late and shaved, tapping my razor handle against my hand to vomit out the hair. I used to tap the sink, but Renee heard it in her dreams.

"Fucking tap tap tap. I hate waking up to that shit. No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a giant razor to the floor.

She was still asleep when I headed out, her hours sat much later in the day than mine. She worked at an aryuvedic clinic deep in Greenpoint. When Renee was late or had mono once a week they accomodated her. benefits were the first few bottles and boxes of newly imported medicine. In between smoke breaks and relabeling expired medicine she'd call or text me about dinner or a movie or gossip. She used to bring home elixirs and herbs promising to revitalize our livers, iron to lighten our eyes, mud smoothies to clear up our digestion tracts. I tried them all but still felt pretty dirty.

On my way down my old clamshell phone rang. Even when turned way down its deep bassy sound rang like a cow begging to be heard against my leg.

Usually I was too lazy to take it out and just hit hard against my pocket until it calmed down. But that day I saw his number crawl across the screen.

"Yea?" wiping my smooth chin.

Dad coughed some static into the phone then replied loudly, "Hey son! Long time no talking! That's how you say hello to your Dad?"

"Oh, hello Dad."

"Why hello son!"

"Hi Dad."

"How's the NEW YORK?"

"Better than the old one I guess."

He faked a light laugh, which I appreciated. "Ah, as GOOD or BETTER?"

"Better." I replied.

"Ok, that's great. Better is very good. You enjoying it there computer scientist guy?"

"Enjoying it, is that the question? It's hard here."

I could hear my Dad breathing heavy into the phone. "Did you run or something Dad?"

"Yes son, I did run. I'm always running everywhere getting things for the family."

"Ah ok."

"So work is good? How is your position? Pay raise?"

We came to a long pause. These were frequent and unbearable. It's not funny, but I can think of so many things to say now but nothing would change. I am positive he would hang up everytime.

"What about the visa situation. Is it done?"

"It's not yet honestly. They are still processing it." It was its eternal state. I knew after a year that they had it on their desk but hadn't opened it yet.

"You have to try to call them. They should give you an update."

"I did call them. I told you I called them. But they don't answer. And when they did answer they said they will contact me when they are through."

"You don't want to come home to visit?"

"It's taking a long time. They told me they will give me an update when its finished. How's business?"

"Well we have to take care of a lot of things son, a lot of things."

"How's business, Dad?

"It's work son. Contracts and people and a lot of bullshit." He sighed heavily into the phone. "Your brother is helping a lot. He has school but he is helping still. You talked to him?"

"Not too recently."

"Please give him a call son." His voice became business like, sincere. "How about your Mom. Do you want to talk your Mom?"

"I kind of have to go I'm busy right now."

"I see son. You are busy."

"I'll call her later, seriously. You can't imagine what it's like here."

"Ok, well let us know son, we are waiting."

I nodded in the right places and held on patiently.

"Call your mother son."

"I will."

A few I love you's were exchanged, and we hung up. I don't remember who hung up first, but it was probably me.

Down to the limo receptionist for me daily ritual. She bore a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She'd hobble busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone three thousand miles away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight, and a huge grin that dangerously firted with tipping her over.

She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" she laughed hard.

The letter was absent, and I could feel the government silently shrug. Another week without the visa. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me.

The hues on a winter subway are all the variations of black you can imagine. The people transform into them but they're all really the same still. The bizarre silence mingled with coughs and low groans, the sniffles.

Every so often the Torah shows up. Someone pulls it out, reads it (sometimes audibly) for a while then puts it away with a kiss. It's shortly followed by mentos or gum.

As we headed up I look down at the stairs to avoid watching the climbing asses dancing in front of me. Even at 9:30am So many people were ((still)) heading to work. The army of commuters dispersed and I followed my usual route to our 43rd street office and found a hulking Michael out front with a white stub between his fingers.

He was an interesting case. At six foot five the man spent his life chasing a medal in the olympic games, and he came out a world champion javelin thrower. After winning the gold he rejoiced. But four years later the world was looking for the next world champion javelin thrower, so he decided to move on to a different challenge behind a desk punching keys. ((maybe a boxer?))

He also decided to take up the challenge of smoking, practicing twice daily.

"Hey Om."

"Good morning."

"Kind of late for morning."

"You know about the gym cruise?" I asked.

"Gym cruise?"

"The gym is advertising a buy in. It means free food and a ride around Liberty island for whoever wants to hear a lecture on how great it'll be to pay hundreds of dollars a month to a gym you won't go to."

Michael itched his neck, "I think I've got to take care of my kid that night."

"You have to take care of your kid every night. It's a free cruise, a free something. Think about it. I don't want to go alone." 

"You're not taking your girl?"

"She won't go."

"That's kind of weird isn't it? Turning down a free cruise?"

"Let me know what you decide."















Mik, the man who hired me, came from a long line of Belgian fashioners, doctors and big businessers. I was straight out of college, interviewing a few days before my graduation. He made me my first offer and I gladly accepted it.

I could mention the Dans and Stans of the office but they stuck out in no particular way. Each with their 'own sense of humor', identical patents pending. The only thing I felt there then was the clock eating away at us diligently as we ran around trying to ignore the bitemarks.

Explaining why my work was lackluster is pretty difficult. What did I want out of it? I went to school to do it, a determination to "succeed" ((succeed)). But what I really wanted was to live the way I wanted to live. To be free from the work and grind each of these cogs assaulted on each other. So I worked, and project timelines slipped, untli I was knee deep in requests and changes that I didn't relate to.

Honestly I hated my job. Briefly, we worked on curriculums for school children, and our most recent project was randomly generating educational paint by number pictures.

With Michael as an exception, I didn't find much leeway with my fellow employees. At lunch they'd argue how much of a pain it was to wash dishes. In the day they would scream about how there were no good snacks.In the evening they would try to make excuses for leaving early.












I asked Michael once why he worked. 

"You call this work?" He asked me casually.

"What else is it?"

"It's de-evolution. We've reached our peak instead of riding horses, fighting wars or grinding things...  We've reached our peak, dancing in space and stuff. To sit. The last step is imminent, that we don't even leave our houses and do nothing. We're almost there. We're all apart of it." He smiled at me but I regretted the question.
