CHAPTER 4

Every other day I woke up late and shaved, tapping my razor handle against my hand to vomit out the hair. I used to tap the sink, but Renee heard it in her dreams. It was far too loud and she hated waking up in the morning to it. "Fucking tap tap tap. No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a huge razor to the floor.

She was still asleep when I headed out, her hours sat much later in the day than mine. She worked at an aryuvedic clinic deep in a corner of Greenpoint. When Renee was late or had mono once a week they accomodated for it. In between smoke breaks and relabeling medicine she'd call or text me about dinner or a movie or gossip. I volunteered briefly out of curiousity but the personalities there were too strong for me. I decided to listen to Renee's tales of the doctors and the far more bizarre patients at a distance. One of the benefits were the first few bottles and boxes of newly imported medicine. She brought home elixirs and herbs promising to revitalize the liver, iron to lighten eyes, tumeric to hydrate you for weeks or mud to clean your digestion. I tried them all and used some of them as spices occassionally.

It came to the point where I couldn't wait for the letter, so the ritual was before work I crept down there to the receptionist. She bore a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She'd hobble busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone 3000 miles away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight, and a huge grin that dangerously firted with tipping her over.

She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" she laughed hard.

Another week and no visa. The government shrugged and said nothing. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me.

The hues on a winter subway are all the variations of black you can imagine. The people transform into them but they're all really the same still. The bizarre silence mingled with coughs and low groans, the sniffles.

Every so often the Torah shows up. Someone pulls it out, reads it (sometimes audibly) for a while then puts it away with a kiss. It's shortly followed by mentos or gum.

As we headed up I look down at the stairs to avoid watching the climbing asses dancing in front of me. Even at 9:30am So many people were ((still)) heading to work. The army of commuters dispersed and I followed my usual route to our 43rd street office and found a hulking Michael out front with a white stub between his fingers.

He was an interesting case. At six foot five he was bound to represent something, which he did. The man spent his life chasing a medal in the olympic games, and he came out a world champion javelin thrower. After winning the gold he rejoiced. But four years later the world was looking for the next world champion javelin thrower, so he decided to move on to a different challenge behind a desk punching keys. ((maybe a boxer?))

He also decided to take up the challenge of smoking, practicing twice daily.

"Hey Om."

"There's a gym cruise." I told him.

"Gym cruise?"

"The gym is advertising a buy in. It means free food and a ride around Liberty island for whoever wants to hear a lecture on how great it'll be to pay hundreds of dollars a month to a gym they won't go to."

Michael itched his beard, "I think I've got to take care of my kid that night."

"You have to take care of your kids every night. It's a free cruise, a free something. Think about it. I don't want to go alone." 

"You're not taking your girl?"

"She won't go."

"That's kind of weird isn't it? Turning down a free cruise?"

"Let me know what you decide."

Mik, the man who hired me, came from a long line of Belgian fashioners, doctors and big businessers. I was straight out of college, interviewing a few days before my graduation. He made me my first offer and I gladly accepted it.








I could mention the Dans and Stans of the office but they stuck out in no particular way. Each with their 'own sense of humor', identical patents pending. The only thing I felt there then was the clock eating away at us diligently as we ran around trying to ignore the bitemarks.

Explaining why my work was lackluster is pretty difficult. What did I want out of it? I went to school to do it, a determination to "succeed" ((succeed)). But what I really wanted was to live the way I wanted to live. To be free from the work and grind each of these cogs assaulted on each other. So I worked, and project timelines slipped, untli I was knee deep in requests and changes that I didn't relate to.

Honestly I hated my job. Briefly, we worked on curriculums for school children, and our most recent project was randomly generating educational paint by number pictures.

With Michael as an exception, I didn't find much leeway with my fellow employees. At lunch they'd argue how much of a pain it was to wash dishes. In the day they would scream about how there were no good snacks.In the evening they would try to make excuses for leaving early.












I asked Michael once why he worked. 

"You call this work?" He asked me casually.

"What else is it?"

"It's de-evolution. We've reached our peak instead of riding horses, fighting wars or grinding things...  We've reached our peak, dancing in space and stuff. To sit. The last step is imminent, that we don't even leave our houses and do nothing. We're almost there. We're all apart of it." He smiled at me but I regretted the question.
