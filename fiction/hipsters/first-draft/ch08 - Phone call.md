~while talking on phone with father~ It's something my father made sure to never understand (Om himself?)




"Hey son! Tall guy!" His voice thundered fuzzing the sound through the phone.

"Hi Dad."

"How you doin?" Long time son!"

"I guess, yea."

"How's your life how's your job?"

"They're ok, doing good."

"Listen son, when do you think you can come back, just visit for a week?"

"I don't know if that's possible Dad. You know I can't go back my visa status hans't gone through yet."

"Oh really? Should be soon right son?"

I leaned against a wall wit my back to it. My eyes closed and imagined my Dad on the other end, then I imagined a beautiful blonde curly haired girl, her face slightly red because she was dutch and because her genetics were tickled by the cold streaming into her shirt that cover her bellybutton. My Dad's voice faded back in but barely.

"----'s Son got it in three week's, you remember them? I don't know how many years it's been since you applied."

"Only five. I don't know when I'll get it but I have to wait for it."

"I see son. It's too bad your brother and sister will be here."

"Yes I know. But if I leave I can't come back."

"Ok I see. It's no problem son. Let me know, let me know if you can come."

"I will Dad."

"You need anything son?"

"No I don't need anything Dad, I'm fine for now."

"Ok well love you son, bye. Good bye." 

"Bye."

"Goodbye" he said, and hung up.
