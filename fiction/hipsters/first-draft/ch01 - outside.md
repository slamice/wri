Something in the air was broken. We were shoved up against a brick wall waiting for it to happen. Out across the silent empty street I thought I saw something move, but only thought. Jack's cigarette smoke lazily crept up disappearing into the ether. The concrete was a bit brighter that night, and the whole area was thick with unrestricted access.

Our venue was a pile tucked above two garages. The owners soldered on a roof with a roof, threw old wood in they were too lazy to dump and charged triple the place's worth a month. The door got stuck often but there was a skylight so you knew you could always leave. The space itself was huge, boxed and sanded down with sooted corners. A huge sign hung in the window:

"Guitar lessons? Dance space rental? Warm bodies? Call us."

It was pretty obvious 'The Woods' wasn't going to last much longer than eight or so months. Three thousands of dollars of rent every thirty days was high budgeted even for the six tenants, especially when the only real job any of them held was barely. At the end of each month they worried, sweating and fumbling. Keeping themselves in check and sober was key, but no amount of coffee or cigarettes could hold back the day that rent was due.

So then there were parties. And then there was us. We looked like a shitty polaroid. 

As couples and triples went inside, we slumped determined to be a desperate plea for attention and as nonchalant about it as possible. At ten o'clock we were waiting for the show to start, probably soon. I made a game out of keeping eye contact with every person who walked in, until they noticed me and I looked away.

"You think Matt'll come?" Jack asked in his typical drawl.

"Which Matt, what are you talking about?" Ryan said, half laughing.

"The guy, Matt, in the band."

"Band guy? Yea he's coming." I said.

My next guess was Matt never shows up. He was usually late and occasionally we'd get pissed at him but we were usually late too. High expectations abound, no one was happy. At least we had cigarettes I didn't smoke. He never shows up.

"What about Renee? Your girlfriend coming out?" Jack said sharing a wicked smile with Ryan.

"She's taking it easy tonight, she's got mono."

"Isn't that one of those things you have for the rest of your life? Something you gave her?" Jack said, rubbing his eczema covered hands against his stubble.

Jack and Ryan were tacked on friends. I met them both in university. Ryan's flair was his curly hair and bright yellow vest. A straight A plus student until college grabbed him by the collar and shoved him into a lazy comma. He remained high on marijuana for eternity. As for lanky Jack, various degrees tried to swoop down on him but he managed to avoid them all. Eventually he gravitated towards a bachelors in philosophy and demonstrated it in slow long sentences. He really reigned in his own world of surreal modern nude canvases.

And another twenty minutes. Jack pulled out his lighter for the 3rd time and lit a cigarette. I made a blank stare at both of them. You know, I invited them out and honestly I didn't know who depressed me more. But those two were innocent compared to the hidden gems inside.

They went in for a bit to check it out, but I could tell they were getting finickidgity ((finicky?) and in a few minutes and, "but seriously man I'm gonna bail. I'm really sorry, but I've got this thing with Sarah tonight and it's like you know me I'm sorry." His sentence bowed and began shuffling away.

"It's not a big deal, you don't have to apologize. I'll see you later though, like another night."

"Really sorry I can't right now." And he slowly walked off waving, with Ryan bumbling and lagging behind him whispering a "me too."

It was a grand time to be alone.

How a show usually played out is posters went up in skate shops, coffee shops, expensive barbershops. Each of these had only three items on their menus, those sorts of places. Doors at eight, started at nine. People knew it really started at ten. Bands keep waiting for their drinks and drunks. They go on at eleven or eleven thirty. It ends at four in the morning after the fourth band, but the police break it up at three. 

Tonight though was a bizarre switch from the usual rigmarole, a 90s dance party. And since it wasn't that kind of show, we didn't technically really have to wait for anyone. But instead we had sixties pop remakes we forgot about on the radio. Mix those with rap and they were in vogue again. It was one night only until the next 90s dance party five months from then.

By now people stupided towards the door. A few already drinking, some lighting up.

I took a deep breath then flew in profusely like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened in front of crowds. Some bumped into me accidentally and intentionally. A few jeered at nothing then laughed.

The lights were dim and confused, spraying in every other direction. I scanned through the crowds casually, and could tell everyone there was an angry teenager wanting to dye some highlights into their memories. The party was a pagan ritual with a dance floor surrounded with quotation marks. Fashion was ripe with faux-paus chic and undeniable clashing that somehow made the word "tacky" look tame. Two were dancing the robot like humans. Straight out of Wonderland were Alices in all colors of the rainbow. A Ghostbuster did a violent shuffle near a spinster, backpack jigging and all.

Many weirds and beards shot each other, the digital polaroids barely drying between takes. Mouths were open, strung out on jargon, cheap beer and dance music. Some girls made a few softcore poses, each holding a meaningless subliminal message.

I recognized a few passing faces in passing. A few more prominent and active members ignored me. A girl I knew who made tapestries gave me a nod. Finally Selina waded into the crowd. I caught fleeting glimpses of her roommate Adrian's fire red hair and round face holding on to her periodic boyfriend Hayden. They were lost in a few ways, most prominently in dancing.

"What's up and yo?" Selina and I pounded hands and laughed. A homely blonde chababy sort, she donned light flannel and a grey cap.

"Yo yo yo. You're looking real grungy."

"I've been wearing this since this morning! How long have you been here?" Her smile was huge.

"Not that long, like half an hour. Thought I would check it out."

"Ch-check-ch-check-ch-checking it out!" She tried to yell over the bad dance style. I heard it because most of the moves around us were just people walking badly.

What was popular possibly eons ago started to play again, and we danced a few jigs trying to steal a few moves from our surroundings, our sights wandering.

"Where's Renee?"

"She couldn't make it tonight, she has mono."

"Sorry to hear that."

Adrian found her way over and pulled Selina by the arm miming for a smoke. The cold air hit us.

"Hey we've got to jam twice this week so we'll be ready for Saturday." Selina looked up at me as I fanned away wafts of marijuana.

"Ah yea ~no kidding~." she blew out and coughed "Oh did you get your papers yet?" with an earnest.

"The visa? No, not yet, it's going to take a while."

"Whatever, government. THE GOVERNMENT!" She yelled. She was against everything government. She gauffed at capitalism and stood in disbelief at the many injustices of the world that were mentioned to her. Her eyes would grow bigger if anyone mentioned grim crimes involving theft, extortion, brutalizing immigrants, women or death. "Oh my god" she'd exclaim between sips from her latte.

Adrian took a toke before passing it to Hayden. I never knew what to say to Selina's friend. She worked in a coffee shop day in day out giving Selina free coffee every time she visited with soy milk of course thanks. Her boyfriend stared at me through his bangs giving me a distinctive ambiguous shrug.

"How long do you wanna stay? I saw Steve inside, we could go to his house afterwards. Kind of an after party thing." Adrian's face grew redder as she inhaled.

"I'm up for that, he's a good guy. Wait, Steve Flemer? Or Steve from 'No Hope?'"

"From the band, yea." Adrian yelled, laughing. "Who's the other guy?"

They trailed off into a world of drama. I turned to Hayden, slunked against the brick wall, asking him what, exactly, was up. Eventually he gave out he was between jobs, working on contract as a graphic designer for a business near the Red Hook waterfront.

"I've been making some show posters too." he sputtered.

"I saw one of them I think, the kiwis with the lasers coming out of their eyes, that-"

"Hah, yea I'm particularly proud of that one."

Shortly after we drifted over to Steve's in a twenty or so minute walk. His house was barren with a mattress, a love seat, a coffee table, weed and a fair oodle of people. We sat next to these strangers underneath the projector playing someone in the world's childhood home movies. The malaise was prefaced with Steve's band Boombastic. It parodied Indian techno in between the yells and mumbles of those jokers.

Steve passed around some blunts and unlabelled pills. I didn't bother to take either off their hands. His voice blended in so well with the world ((atmosphere?)) I couldn't distinguish it at first when he turned to me.

"You don't want any?" he held a roach out to me.

"I'm not so sure you'd be happy with the results."

"I don't know man sometimes it's nice to find out what those are."

"No, I'm good."

"That's cool."

I nodded at a few more things he said muffled by the music and the crowd, then he was hard at work entertaining Adrian and Hayden.

Nothing was left untouched by the thick smoke haze. The dull florescent lights in the kitchen loved it. Moving among the bodies, one motioned me over.

It was Jack's roommate Prof's latest craze. She was hard to forget. Her teased out auburn hair framed her light face, a soft tan dust with a freckle finish. Prof woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you."  He gloated about it afterwards like that's all it took. She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

((The trenchcoat, the khaki shorts, the fire on her shirt, it was all wrong.))

"Hey."

"Hey Gala."

She confirmed she was still silk screening, but times were tough. "Is Jack around?"

"I don't know is he? I was with him earlier but-"

"You going to see him anytime soon? I hear he's living with Prof now." She chewed on half her lip and then sucked on her bottle.

"You want something from him? Why not ask Prof?"

"No, we're, not really talking right now. Haven't been for a while. It's why I need my mail from him. My last cheque went to his address. I mean, no pressure but, if you go, you know."

"It's your mail? I don't know where you live now."

She opened her purse and took out a ballpoint penning the back of my hand with her number. "If you do go, just call me and I'll swing by wherever. I'm not sure what to do at this point."

Her breathe grazed my face and I caught a gilmpse of her grannysmith ((too hokey? amateur?)) green eyes. Without a word I said I'd see what I could do.

















I stared at my phone incessantly. The hum was like a cow 

















So I left Selina at the party and I walked home. My steps were slow and my direction was mostly aimless. I counted the buildings I passed and the people who stood outside the few clubs that remained open. I passed a prostitute who puffed up her boobs into the hole of her v-neck. I passed by the many overnight parked cars. A couple, if they were that legitimately, startled me with their discreet argument as I passed by a random car.

I was sketched out, my hands were in my pockets, my right gripping my keys and flipping through them. That night Dad didn't call.
























They lept in deep and discarded themselves in an abyss o

















The last line of protection was hard fought.


































On my way back from the kitchen someone motioned me over. It was Prof's latest craze.

She wore mostly black but couldn't feign a dark look. Teased out out auburn hair framed her light face with a freckle finish. When she spoke her pure white teeth glared. If you weren't careful you'd be cught off gaurd by what kind of beautiful creature could dwell in this pit.

set apart from the room's malaise

Her large brown hair teased out curly at the end. She had an incredibly beautiful smile was brighter than that kitchen could have ever hoped to be. She was still wearing her trenchcoat, an army greenjacket and some shorts. Our hug smelled like liquorice and was just as strong.

"Hey Gala."

"Hey."

Think lost look but radiant. Prof, another loose friend and Jack's roommate, woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you."  Prof gloated about it afterwards like that's all it took. She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

She confirmed she was still silk screening since the last party I talked to her at a few weeks before. 

"Prof around?"

"I don't know is he?"

"Maybe, I don't know."

She bit her lip in pretend frustration. She was trying to ask me something, she could have asked anything of me really and I would have gladly followed through.

"You going to see him anytime soon? I hear he's living with Jack now."

"Well, can I ask a favor?"

"A favor. You want me to do something for him?"

"No, we're, not really talking right now. Haven't been for a while. It's why I need my mail from him. My last cheque went to his address, I wanted to know if you went by you could pick it up for me."

"I don't know where you live now."

She opened her purse and took out a ballpoint penning the back of my hand with her number. "If you do go, just call me and I'll swing by wherever. I'm not sure what to do at this point." Her breathe grazed my face as I looked into her grannysmith green eyes. And I said I'd see what I could do. We drifted shortly after that.

So I left Selina at the party and I walked home. My steps were slow and my direction was mostly aimless. I counted the buildings I passed and the people who stood outside the few clubs that remained open. I passed a prostitute who puffed up her boobs into the hole of her v-neck. I passed by the many overnight parked cars. A couple, if they were that legitimately, startled me with their discreet argument as I passed by a random car.

I was sketched out, my hands were in my pockets, my right gripping my keys and flipping through them. That night Dad didn't call.

The hazy room . Words drifting in the air next to them. They were cut up by the music and popped like bubbles as they spoke. Adrian's round face looked like a laughing cloud. My memory reduces Hayden was only to his fat nose getting high.

Selina grabbed me hard by the arm and let me to a corner and we got up, and led me to a corner. Her eyes were a bit bloodshot and half closed dreamily. She smirked like a thoroughly candied child. We didn't need to shout anymore and I smiled with her.

"Is this the after party or the after after party?"

"Hmmm..." she wondered, her lips thoroughly pushed up exaggerated, "Has kind of an after-after party feel. I think we skipped one." and then her eyes opened up fully and I could see her red cornea canals, "We NEED to get a show Steve."

"WE NEED TO GET A SHOW WITH STEVE."

"He's got so many connections and he's such a nice guy."

"Adrian barely knows him though."

"We could tour Europe with them Om." and then she whispered, "we could tour..."

"How?" after realizing she was serious.

"They have a record deal. We could piggy back off of them. It would be the greatest time of your life Om."

I thought about any possible complications.

"You'll get your visa by then! It's been years! Om! Om!" she stared me in the eyes, paused. Her hands started stuffing invisible scones and butter rolls in her mouth "Om Om Om." she laughed to infinity and I joined in for a bit. It was so stupid we never got tired of it.

We drifted to other parts of the party. I leaned against the wall and watched the room unfold. It and the people in it felt shruggy and benevolent, smoking away to a low psychedelic hymn ignoring each other moderately.

I sat around for a bit more. I peer at the girls, drinking up various brown liquids. Most in black and two in camo jackets. I think they're beautiful on the outside. I take a look at the boys, rolling weed and describing their lives.

A mustashio'ed man wearing a reggae mop leaned a few feet away from me in silence. I peered over at him.

"When did you get here?" I whispered to him.

He ignored me briefly, but then breathed out without looking at me "about half an hour ago I guess. I'm getting tired already."

"Yea I know what you mean." When I really didn't.

"It's getting pretty late." He sulked, then smiled at himself profoundly.

"I've been tired before I even got here." I chuckled truthfully, but it was impossible to know if he was listening. He didn't look at me yet or ever again and left it at that. He walked away straight faced, taking his bloodshot eyes with him. I mulled that over in my head, and I only heard silence above the muttering people and the droning music.
