Something in the air was broken. It felt banal and burnt to an odorless cinder. I smelt it still somehow, felt it and watched it with my eyes, deadpan. Out across the silent empty street, I thought I saw something move, but only thought.

Cars swept by hissing cats. The area was thick with unrestricted access. The venue itself was tucked above two garages. The owners soldered on a roof with a roof, threw old wood in they were too lazy to dump and charged triple the apartment's worth a month. The door got stuck often but there was a skylight so you knew you could always leave. The space itself was huge, boxed and sanded down with sooted corners. The renters hung a sign outside:

"Guitar lessons? Dance space rental? Warm bodies? Call us."

It was pretty obvious 'The Woods' wasn't going to last much longer than eight or so months. Three thousands of dollars of rent every 30 days was high budgeted even for the 6 renters, especially when the only real job any of them held was barely. At the end of each month they worried, sweatily fumbling. Keeping themselves in check and sober was key, but no amount of coffee or cigarettes could hold back the day the rent was due.

So then there were parties. And then there was us. Shoved up and rotting (()) against the outside brick wall as if hung on it, the three of us watched couples and triples go inside. We were determined to be a desperate plea for attention and as nonchalant about it as possible. It was 10 o'clock, waiting for the show to start, probably soon. I tried to keep eye contact with every person who walked in, until they noticed me and I looked away.

"You think Matt'll come?" Jack asked.

"Which Matt, what are you talking about?" Ryan said, half laughing.

"The guy, Matt, in the band."

"Band guy? Yea he's coming." I said.

My next guess was Matt never shows up. He was usually late and occasionally we'd get pissed at him but we were usually late too. High expectations abound, no one was happy. At least we had cigarettes I didn't smoke.

"What about Renee? Your girlfriend coming out?" Jack said it, but both him and Ryan gave some wicked smiles.

"She's taking it easy tonight, she's got mono."

"Isn't that one of those things you have for the rest of your life?"

"Something you gave her?" We all noticed when Jack itched his eczema hands, rubbed them against his stuble. After it he'd pull out a small bottle and dot lotion all over them to continue the cycle.

To me Mono sounded like the most convenient disease to get yourslef out of anything. You sit in bed until you're awake to sit in bed.

Jack and Ryan were tacked on friends. I met them both in university. Ryan was a straight A plus student until college grabbed him by the collar and shoved him into a lazy comma. He remained high on marijuana for eternity. As for Jack, various college degrees tried to swoop down on him, but he was great at avoiding them. Eventually he gravitated towards a bachelors in philosophy and did nothing with it. He sported shoulder length hair, was often seen chittering occasionally wore no shoes. Jack reigned in his own world of canvases featuring surreal modern nude art. He was a pole in every way, quite a lanky questionable sort.

We looked like a shitty polaroid. I started to drift from Jack and Ryan there. I invited them out but honestly I didn't know who depressed me more. These two were innocent compared to the hidden gems inside.

Jack pulled out his lighter for the 3rd time and lit a cigarette. I looked blankly at both of them.


--------------


We were there for another 20 minutes. They went in for a bit to check it out, but I could tell they were getting finicky. Jack finished his cigarette in a few minutes and, "but seriously man I'm gonna bail. I'm really sorry, but I've got this thing with Sarah tonight and it's like you know me I'm sorry." His sentence bowed, shuffled and shrugged.

"It's not a big deal, you don't have to apologize. I'll see you later though, like another night."

"Really sorry I can't right now." And he slowly walked off waving, with Ryan bumbling and lagging behind him whispering a "me too." Matt never showed up either.

It was a grand time to be alone.

How a show usually played out is posters went up in skate shops, coffee shops, really expensive barbershops. Each of these had only 3 items on their menus, those sorts of places. Doors at 8, started at 9. People knew it really started at 10. Bands keep waiting for their drinks and drunks. They go on at 11 or 11:30. It ends at 4am after the fourth band, but the police break it up at 3am. If the show ended earlier (at least by midnight) then fools would dance. Tonight was a bizarre switch from the usual rigamarol, a dance party. It was probably _a thing_ I guess.

And since it wasn't that kind of show though, we didn't technically really have to wait for anyone. It was 90's Dance night and that's a guaranteed win. Everyone there was an angry teenager wanting to dye some highlights into their memories. But instead we had 60's pop remakes we forgot about on the radio. Mix that with rap and they're in vogue again. It was one night only until the next 90's dance party five months from then.

By now people stupided towards the door, a few already drinking, a few more warming up with headbands. Some beards were abound, a few lit up.

I took a breath then flew in profusely like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened in front of crowds. Some bumped into me accidentally and intentionally. A few jeered at nothing then laughed.

The party was a pagan dance. 90's theme be damned. Someone threw up the 60's, 70's, 90's (but mostly the eighties) onto some far and not finely aged wasted teenage bodies. Everyone was clad with chababyness. The dance floor was surrounded with quotation marks. Fashion was ripe with faux-paus chic and undeniable clashing that somehow made the word "tacky" look tame. Two were dancing the robot like humans. Straight out of Wonderland were Alices in all colors of the rainbow. A ghostbuster did a violent shuffle near a spinster, backpack jigging and all.

Many weirds and beards shot each other, the digital polaroids barely drying between takes. Mouths were open, strung out on jargon, cheap beer and dance music. Some girls made a few soft-core poses, each holding a meaningless subliminal message.

I scanned through the crowds casually. The lights were dim and confused, spraying in every other direction. I recognized a few passing faces in passing.  A few more prominent and active members ignored me. I made a hard nod at one girl made tapestries. Finally Selina waded into the crowd. I caught fleeting glimpses of Selina's roommate Adrian and her periodic boyfriend. They were lost in a few ways, most prominently in dancing.

"What's up and yo?" Selina and I pounded hands and laughed. She donned light flannel and a grey cap.

"Yo yo yo. You're looking really grungy."

"I've been wearing this since this morning! How long have you been here?" Her smile was huge.

"Not that long, like half an hour. Thought I would check it out."

"Ch-check-ch-check-ch-checking it out!" She tried to yell over the bad dance style. I heard it because most of the moves around us were just people walking badly.

What was popular possibly eons ago started to play again. We danced a few jigs and tried to steal a few dance moves from our surroundings. We shuffled left and right and looked around us.

"Where's Renee?"

"She couldn't make it tonight, she has mono."

"Sorry to hear that."

About 20 minutes later Selina's friend Adrian formed out of thin air and pulled Selina by the arm miming a smoker. I followed them outside, and the cold air hit us once again.

"Hey we've got to jam twice this week so we're ready for Saturday." Selina looked up at me as she lit up, and I fanned away wafts of marijuana.

"Ah yea ~no kidding~." she blew out and coughed a bit. "Oh did you get your papers yet?" with an earnest.

"Not yet, it's going to take a while."

"Whatever, government. THE GOVERNMENT!" She yelled. Selina was against everything government. She gauffed at capitalism and stood honestly in disbelief at the many injustices of the world mentioned to her. Her eyes would literally grow bigger if anyone mentioned grim crimes involving theft, extortion, brutalizing women or death. "Oh my god" she would usually exclaim between sips from her latte.

Adrian took a toke next to her with her boyfriend Hayden. I never really did know what to say to her friend. She worked in a coffee shop day in day out, surrounded by people who looked familiar but I didn't know. She gave Selina free coffee every time she visited with soy milk of course thanks. She coughed it up a bit, her face red. To Selina,

"How long do you wanna stay? I saw Steve inside, we could go to his house afterwards. Kind of an after party thing."

"I'm up for that, he's a good guy. Wait, Steve Flemer? Or Steve from 'No Hope?'"

"From No Hope." Adrian yelled, laughing. "Who's the other guy?"

They trailed off into a world of drama. I turned to Hayden, also slunked against the brick wall, and ask him what, exactly, was up. He said nothing in particular, which was nothing. A distinctive ambiguous shrug. Eventually he gave out that he was between jobs, working on contract as a graphic designer for a business by the waterfront. "I've been making some show posters too."

"I saw one of them I think, the kiwis with the lasers coming out of their eyes, that-"

"Hah, yea I'm particularly proud of that one."

"To Steve's!" Adrian yelled. Selina followed suit, and we slowly walked to Adrian's cyan beetle and piled in.

Inevitably, Adrian began discussing her family for a bit. People in her story were drunk, had financial problems. Selina and I echoed "Yea I know that's hard."

"I don't know what to do about my Dad. I don't know what to do. So many family issues and nothing gets resolved, you know?" She was talking strictly to Selina.

"No kidding that's hard." Selina stared out into the street. For a bit we drove in her bug silently. Hayden flipped through radio stations until he gave up. It coughed up something we didn't recognize, but we were lulled by it and the static with every turn down a street. A few cats were lying on sidewalks waiting to be petted.

"Did you hear about Darren?" Adrian said, her voice a bit less scratchy and distressed.

"Oh my god what a disaster." Hayden echoed.

 Selina woke up "No, what about him? Didn't he have a show recently?" I could see Adrian was still, her mouth straightened and formed slowly, over the next few minutes, into a frown.

 "Him and Gabe were playing a show at The Laundry Room the other day. With his band Hellen Killer? You know. Darren thought that it would be cool if he brought some lighter fluid right? It would be a great show. He dumped a bit on his guitar and lit it on fire, and continued to play as much as he could. But the space is pretty small, and the fire slowly got out of control. The whole place was wood. And while he was taking his guitar off he kicked the lighter fluid into the crowd. This girl ended up catching on fire and the paramedics came. It was 2 a.m. and everyone was panicking."

"****" I said, any expression I had before fell to the floor of the car, rolling back and forth as the car turned.

"What happened to the girl?" Selina whispered in shock.

"Well the horrible thing is she ended up in the hospital with two degree burns. Everyone is blaming them and berating Darren and Gabe any way they can. On their flyers too now. It's horrible. They visited the girl in the hospital a few times and apologized." Adrian then turned to Selina, stern, "It didn't make a difference. Also The Laundry Room is gone, it burnt down that night. No one can play there any more."

"God, that's horrible." Selina said.

"No one stops telling them they're jerks. I mean no one thinks about them. Darren feels horrible and they don't have to make him feel any worse. They probably won't play for months too, how could they?"


----------

Adrian parked on the street and we headed quietly towards Steve's house. A fair oodle of people were already inside. The place was barely furnished, toppled in and out of itself. The living room was a mattress, love seat and a short coffee table with papers and weed. We sat down next to these stranger underneath the projector.  Steve started up some indian music. His band, Boombastic, practically stole all these rhythms and put a beat to them.

This environment sat nicely with the rest of the people hanging out there, about fifteen more or so. All friends of his roommates or friends. They passed around some sort of blunt and pills I didn't recognize. I didn't bother to take either off their hands. Steve was hard at work entertaining Adrian and Hayden. His voice fit so well in the background I couldn't distinguish it at first when he turned to me, "Why don't you smoke up?"

"I'm not so sure I'd be happy with the results."

"I don't know man sometimes it's nice to find out what those are. But that's cool." I nodded at a few more things he said muffled by the music and the crowd, then he went back to Adrian and Hayden promptly.

Looking back, I remember not wondering about Renee. I remember staring at those faces, hazy through the smoke. Words drifting in the air next to them. They were cut up by the music and popped like bubbles as they spoke. Adrian's round face looked like a laughing cloud. My memory reduces Hayden was only to his fat nose getting high.

Selina grabbed me hard by the arm and let me to a corner and we got up, and led me to a corner. Her eyes were a bit bloodshot and half closed dreamily. She smirked like a thoroughly candied child. We didn't need to shout anymore and I smiled with her.

"Is this the after party or the after after party?"

"Hmmm..." she wondered, her lips thoroughly pushed up exaggerated, "Has kind of an after-after party feel. I think we skipped one." and then her eyes opened up fully and I could see her red cornea canals, "We NEED to get a show Steve."

"WE NEED TO GET A SHOW WITH STEVE."

"He's got so many connections and he's such a nice guy."

"Adrian barely knows him though."

"We could tour Europe with them Om." and then she whispered, "we could tour..."

"How?" after realizing she was serious.

"They have a record deal. We could piggy back off of them. It would be the greatest time of your life Om."

I thought about any possible complications.

"You'll get your visa by then! It's been years! Om! Om!" she stared me in the eyes, paused. Her hands started stuffing invisible scones and butter rolls in her mouth "Om Om Om." she laughed to infinity and I joined in for a bit. It was so stupid we never got tired of it.

We drifted to other parts of the party. I leaned against the wall and watched the room unfold. It and the people in it felt shruggy and benevolent, smoking away to a low psychedelic hymn ignoring each other moderately.

I sat around for a bit more. I peer at the girls, drinking up various brown liquids. Most in black and two in camo jackets. I think they're beautiful on the outside. I take a look at the boys, rolling weed and describing their lives.

A mustashio'ed man wearing a reggae mop leaned a few feet away from me in silence. I peered over at him.

"When did you get here?" I whispered to him.

He ignored me briefly, but then breathed out without looking at me "about half an hour ago I guess. I'm getting tired already."

"Yea I know what you mean." When I really didn't.

"It's getting pretty late." He sulked, then smiled at himself profoundly.

"I've been tired before I even got here." I chuckled truthfully, but it was impossible to know if he was listening. He didn't look at me yet or ever again and left it at that. He walked away straight faced, taking his bloodshot eyes with him. I mulled that over in my head, and I only heard silence above the muttering people and the droning music.

Parties like these were brutally exhausting without something substantial to dull me. Weed was usually the norm but light drinking was another option I took up. I never overindulged, but inhaled just enough to feel like it was working. 

On my way back from the kitchen someone motioned me over. Her large brown hair teased out curly at the end. She had an incredibly beautiful smile was brighter than that kitchen could have ever hoped to be. She was still wearing her trenchcoat, an army greenjacket and some shorts. Our hug smelled like liquorice and was just as strong.

"Hey Gala."

"Hey."

Think lost look but radiant. Prof, another loose friend and Jack's roommate, woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you."  Prof gloated about it afterwards like that's all it took. She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

She confirmed she was still silk screening since the last party I talked to her at a few weeks before. 

"Prof around?"

"I don't know is he?"

"Maybe, I don't know."

She bit her lip in pretend frustration. She was trying to ask me something, she could have asked anything of me really and I would have gladly followed through.

"You going to see him anytime soon? I hear he's living with Jack now."

"Well, can I ask a favor?"

"A favor. You want me to do something for him?"

"No, we're, not really talking right now. Haven't been for a while. It's why I need my mail from him. My last cheque went to his address, I wanted to know if you went by you could pick it up for me."

"I don't know where you live now."

She opened her purse and took out a ballpoint penning the back of my hand with her number. "If you do go, just call me and I'll swing by wherever. I'm not sure what to do at this point." Her breathe grazed my face as I looked into her grannysmith green eyes. ANd I said I'd see what I could do. We drifted shortly after that.

So I left Selina at the party and I walked home. My steps were slow and my direction was mostly aimless. I counted the buildings I passed and the people who stood outside the few clubs that remained open. I passed a prostitute who puffed up her boobs into the hole of her v-neck. I passed by the many overnight parked cars. A couple, if they were that legitimately, startled me with their discreet argument as I passed by a random car.

I was sketched out, my hands were in my pockets, my right gripping my keys and flipping through them.
