- OM - Searching within and trying to escape does not forgive you from living life.

From OM wiki page:

The legend in section 1.2 of Chandogya Upanishad states that gods took the Udgitha (song of Om) unto themselves, thinking, "with this [song] we shall overcome the demons".[52]

Demons are still around while you're singing.

- Hipster life - an extreme, if not ultimate, version of first world problems. 

- Taking accountability is imporant. Choosing to be smarter then you are, ignorance, priveledge, or self loathing just digs a deeper hole for yourself.

- Cannot escape your past, need to face it to resolve it.

One of the main themes is wasted water. Water pours down drains unused, lost within seconds. Reflects lost chances and situations.
