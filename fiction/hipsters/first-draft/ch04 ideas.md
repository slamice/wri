On the platform was a performer dressed in a full suit playing drums. He sang reggae as he played. I didn't know him but that man had troubles and all that I'm sure. Otherwise he wouldn't play Jamaican music in the subway. But watching him closely, his eyes were loose and unsettled staring every which way, I was unsure how he could play calming music. ((I wondered if he was climbing out of his hole or further in it.)) A friend of mine form university learned how to play the marimba in Zimbabwe. I asked her what thier songs were about since the high notes sounded so chipper. But they were all depressing songs, abuot mourning and death. Maybe this Jamacican man was winging it.



((I remember that night distinctly because it was like any other night.))

A group of girls sexilyed by me, some in tattered jeans, others in what looked like just shirts, shorts hidden in the midst. I was disgusted to think so, but hardly guilty. There was a Native American selling original symmetric artwork. She yelled twenty for each piece and I wondered if it was offensive that someone tried to talk her down to five.

A bit further along, the projects were trying to project onto me, brooding over . The people who lived there almost all had projects. Brutal two day jobs, brutal lack of childcare for their oh so many children and brutal laziness. Distanced, there were convenient stores far too expensive to be convenient. The arrangement was all a maze of zoning left over from a previous era.

I swear I didn't know anything about my aunts, uncles or cousins. Only that they were 'doing fine'. Any operations, epileptic seizures, sometimes even deaths were swept somewhere. Not under a run but in his pocket, ready to strategically come out at the right biting arguments. Well, barely arguments, because my nods were only accompanying his lectures like dutiful claps throughout them.

They were weak and dry and overbearing.

I hadn't recently, but I did try them a month prior and that was its eternal state, "PROCESSING". It was in their inbox. They could see the envelope, one in a sea of lives at their post office. They could touch it, taste it, smell it. That's what they said over the phone. But the queue was long, they even had to cut a hole in the ceiling to fit the height of the stack. ((Hilarious.)) So they still hadn't opened it.

















==============







You knew it was fresh because a guy (owner?) was eating an acai bowl in front of it.



























Usually I was too lazy to take it out and just hit hard against my pocket until it calmed down. But that day I saw his number crawl across the screen.

"Yea?" wiping my smooth chin.

Dad coughed some static into the phone then replied loudly, "Hey son! Long time no talking! That's how you say hello to your Dad?"

"Oh, hello Dad."

"Why hello son!"

"Hi Dad."

"How's the NEW YORK?"

"Better than the old one I guess."

He faked a light laugh, which I appreciated. "Ah, as GOOD or BETTER?"

"Better." I replied.

"Ok, that's great. Better is very good. You enjoying it there computer scientist guy?"

"Enjoying it, is that the question? It's hard here."

I could hear my Dad breathing heavy into the phone. "Did you run or something Dad?"

"Yes son, I did run. I'm always running everywhere getting things for the family."

"Ah ok."

"So work is good? How is your position? Pay raise?"

We came to a long pause. These were frequent and unbearable. It's not funny, but I can think of so many things to say now but nothing would change. I am positive he would hang up everytime.

"What about the visa situation. Is it done?"

"It's not yet honestly. They are still processing it." It was its eternal state. I knew after a year that they had it on their desk but hadn't opened it yet.

"You have to try to call them. They should give you an update."

"I did call them. I told you I called them. But they don't answer. And when they did answer they said they will contact me when they are through."

"You don't want to come home to visit?"

"It's taking a long time. They told me they will give me an update when its finished. How's business?"

"Well we have to take care of a lot of things son, a lot of things."

"How's business, Dad?

"It's work son. Contracts and people and a lot of bullshit." He sighed heavily into the phone. "Your brother is helping a lot. He has school but he is helping still. You talked to him?"

"Not too recently."

"Please give him a call son." His voice became business like, sincere. "How about your Mom. Do you want to talk your Mom?"

"I kind of have to go I'm busy right now."

"I see son. You are busy."

"I'll call her later, seriously. You can't imagine what it's like here."

"Ok, well let us know son, we are waiting."

I nodded in the right places and held on patiently.

"Call your mother son."

"I will."

A few I love you's were exchanged, and we hung up. I don't remember who hung up first, but it was probably me.

The hues on a winter subway are all the variations of black you can imagine. The people transform into them but they're all really the same still. The bizarre silence mingled with coughs and low groans, the sniffles.

Every so often the Torah shows up. Someone pulls it out, reads it (sometimes audibly) for a while then puts it away with a kiss. It's shortly followed by mentos or gum.

As we headed up I look down at the stairs to avoid watching the climbing asses dancing in front of me. Even at 9:30am So many people were ((still)) heading to work. 




























I asked Michael once why he worked. 

"You call this work?" He asked me casually.

"What else is it?"

"It's de-evolution. We've reached our peak instead of riding horses, fighting wars or grinding things...  We've reached our peak, dancing in space and stuff. To sit. The last step is imminent, that we don't even leave our houses and do nothing. We're almost there. We're all apart of it." He smiled at me but I regretted the question.
