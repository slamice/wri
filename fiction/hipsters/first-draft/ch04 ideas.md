On the platform was a performer dressed in a full suit playing drums. He sang reggae as he played. I didn't know him but that man had troubles and all that I'm sure. Otherwise he wouldn't play Jamaican music in the subway. But watching him closely, his eyes were loose and unsettled staring every which way, I was unsure how he could play calming music. ((I wondered if he was climbing out of his hole or further in it.)) A friend of mine form university learned how to play the marimba in Zimbabwe. I asked her what thier songs were about since the high notes sounded so chipper. But they were all depressing songs, abuot mourning and death. Maybe this Jamacican man was winging it.



((I remember that night distinctly because it was like any other night.))

A group of girls sexilyed by me, some in tattered jeans, others in what looked like just shirts, shorts hidden in the midst. I was disgusted to think so, but hardly guilty. There was a Native American selling original symmetric artwork. She yelled twenty for each piece and I wondered if it was offensive that someone tried to talk her down to five.

A bit further along, the projects were trying to project onto me, brooding over . The people who lived there almost all had projects. Brutal two day jobs, brutal lack of childcare for their oh so many children and brutal laziness. Distanced, there were convenient stores far too expensive to be convenient. The arrangement was all a maze of zoning left over from a previous era.

I swear I didn't know anything about my aunts, uncles or cousins. Only that they were 'doing fine'. Any operations, epileptic seizures, sometimes even deaths were swept somewhere. Not under a run but in his pocket, ready to strategically come out at the right biting arguments. Well, barely arguments, because my nods were only accompanying his lectures like dutiful claps throughout them.

They were weak and dry and overbearing.

I hadn't recently, but I did try them a month prior and that was its eternal state, "PROCESSING". It was in their inbox. They could see the envelope, one in a sea of lives at their post office. They could touch it, taste it, smell it. That's what they said over the phone. But the queue was long, they even had to cut a hole in the ceiling to fit the height of the stack. ((Hilarious.)) So they still hadn't opened it.

















==============







You knew it was fresh because a guy (owner?) was eating an acai bowl in front of it.



























Usually I was too lazy to take it out and just hit hard against my pocket until it calmed down. But that day I saw his number crawl across the screen.

"Yea?" wiping my smooth chin.

Dad coughed some static into the phone then replied loudly, "Hey son! Long time no talking! That's how you say hello to your Dad?"

"Oh, hello Dad."

"Why hello son!"

"Hi Dad."

"How's the NEW YORK?"

"Better than the old one I guess."

He faked a light laugh, which I appreciated. "Ah, as GOOD or BETTER?"

"Better." I replied.

"Ok, that's great. Better is very good. You enjoying it there computer scientist guy?"

"Enjoying it, is that the question? It's hard here."

I could hear my Dad breathing heavy into the phone. "Did you run or something Dad?"

"Yes son, I did run. I'm always running everywhere getting things for the family."

"Ah ok."

"So work is good? How is your position? Pay raise?"

We came to a long pause. These were frequent and unbearable. It's not funny, but I can think of so many things to say now but nothing would change. I am positive he would hang up everytime.

"What about the visa situation. Is it done?"

"It's not yet honestly. They are still processing it." It was its eternal state. I knew after a year that they had it on their desk but hadn't opened it yet.

"You have to try to call them. They should give you an update."

"I did call them. I told you I called them. But they don't answer. And when they did answer they said they will contact me when they are through."

"You don't want to come home to visit?"

"It's taking a long time. They told me they will give me an update when its finished. How's business?"

"Well we have to take care of a lot of things son, a lot of things."

"How's business, Dad?

"It's work son. Contracts and people and a lot of bullshit." He sighed heavily into the phone. "Your brother is helping a lot. He has school but he is helping still. You talked to him?"

"Not too recently."

"Please give him a call son." His voice became business like, sincere. "How about your Mom. Do you want to talk your Mom?"

"I kind of have to go I'm busy right now."

"I see son. You are busy."

"I'll call her later, seriously. You can't imagine what it's like here."

"Ok, well let us know son, we are waiting."

I nodded in the right places and held on patiently.

"Call your mother son."

"I will."

A few I love you's were exchanged, and we hung up. I don't remember who hung up first, but it was probably me.

The hues on a winter subway are all the variations of black you can imagine. The people transform into them but they're all really the same still. The bizarre silence mingled with coughs and low groans, the sniffles.

Every so often the Torah shows up. Someone pulls it out, reads it (sometimes audibly) for a while then puts it away with a kiss. It's shortly followed by mentos or gum.

As we headed up I look down at the stairs to avoid watching the climbing asses dancing in front of me. Even at 9:30am So many people were ((still)) heading to work. 




























I asked Michael once why he worked. 

"You call this work?" He asked me casually.

"What else is it?"

"It's de-evolution. We've reached our peak instead of riding horses, fighting wars or grinding things...  We've reached our peak, dancing in space and stuff. To sit. The last step is imminent, that we don't even leave our houses and do nothing. We're almost there. We're all apart of it." He smiled at me but I regretted the question.











---------------------

There was nothing to rage against. They didn’t even stand for survival. They were built to be toppled down to nothing.



"You work for a hedgefund."

"I work for a hedgefund" she grimaced.

"How do you like it?"

"It was all part of the plan."

"Your life plan?"

"My parents were fickle and wanted to abort me. So I decided to work at a hedgefund before I was born, hoping they'd catch wind of it."

It was ok but I didn't laugh, she loudly sipped her coffee. "It's about SURVIVAL." she growled, "Are you surviving?"

It was a good question mostly because I wasn't sure, but she got back to it.

She looked down at her coffee and then up. Her smile reached through my mouth deep into my throat and clutched my chest further. 

She told me more. About her brother, about her life on long island and when she went to Italy and Austria. New York City was an obvious option, she aimed for New York. She flailed and writhed until she perched on a junior accountant branch. She's been friends with New York all her life.

So an hour later she was much better, but while we were still tired, we walked down small twisted streets. We found a stoop and rested there before it became too awkward.

At that point I said I wasn't ticklish either, but she reached around my stomach and almost fully into my pants feeling her fingers graze my pubic hair. She continued searching for a twinge or a wince, but I offered her nothing. Her hand was warm and her body leaned on me while I smelled her drunk coffee breathe and hair. She was fully entrenched in finding what wasn't there, any sort of feeling. She took them out and messed my hair.

"No fun" she puckered her lips and fell back a bit. "Where's your girlfriend?"

With too little hesitation (((make this less obvious))), "I don't have one."

"You're a liar."

"_You're_ a cute liar. Where's _your_ boyfriend?" Wherever is convenient.

"... What do you do again?"

"I don't know didn't I te-, told you twice already."

A crowbar rapped the pangs of guilt rapped against my stomach walls, and I felt them ringing. They were thick, heavy and hollow. Full of airy worry. They plumed inside, but I tried to use the excitement to my advantage to fuel my intentions.

"You want to know my name?"

"No." She said.


"You know what my favourite thing is?"

She leaned in closer, "I'll tell you"

"Whispering. It makes me feel.. So comfortable." She purred.

We were half asleep though, and after we kissed a few times I gave her a fake number which she lazily swore she'd remember and didn't look back.

In the shower I scratched my back, my scalp, my forehead, my face. I dug at them, hopeful New York City hadn’t laid into me too hard before that night. But thick grey dirt and whitehead ((muck)) was caked thick under my fingernails. I let the water wash it all down 


The water pressure used to be so powerful you could hose down an elephant until Renee demanded I talk to the landlord. Now it lazily sprayed a trickle down my

Home, I wiped at my face and brow with a napkin to get any scent out. When I came home I went directly to the shower. Renee was on the bed, topless eating small hard pretzels. She asked me how it was and I said great, and she barely did the laundry so she never knew and never found out.






“It takes so much out of you until you’re empty.”


“There’s 
“The best kind of cockatiel is the one on fire.”











when she said,

The train stopped and she got off chucking a goodbye.







obscenities everyone was too tired to reiterate. 

Trying to approach her carefully, circling the social situation like birds (vultures over the kill maybe?)


Talk about family and loneliness in city vs in Lebanon 







A rat briefly distracted us on the tracks. Giddy and excited, it was looking for what exactly? Everyone tried to look all nonchalant, because they showed up all the time. There was nothing down there but track fires anyway. 

"Alright, well she's my ticket," rubbing her fingers together, "for a real job. She works at a campaign. I can print their shirts and stuff." She showed her teeth as she smiled, running her fingers down her curls.

"You like the people on the boat?"

A rat briefly distracted us on the tracks, "Th-there were a few of those, yea. I mean there were some that were just, I don't know, like, 'in general' people. But there are always a few gems."


“You going home?”

“Yea I’m going back to my couch in soho.” 
The train screeched into the station and we gravitated towards each other by a pole. 




We sat on the stoop afterwards, feeling full and tired from being so with a headache beginning to climb into my forehead.

The street 






I will turn you inside out












She smiled wearily, "Yea I'm going to my brother's this weekend. We always fight over the car, but I'm getting it this time," she lifted her index finger high up above her nose, "I made sure of that."




-------













 and said "where are you going?"

"I'm going to my apartment." 













-------













 and said "where are you going?"

"I'm going to my apartment." She slurred and wobbled. She looked at my face and squinted like she was trying to find an object in a painting.

"How about we go for a coffee or something?"

She looked at me with smiling red eyes and crossed her arms, leaning against a pillar and crossing her legs. "You think that's a good idea? You think your girlfriend would be up for that?" She wavered like a leaf about to fall off.

"I just figure you should sober up before going back to your boyfriend's place." My heart beat in my dry throat.

She stood, silent and confused, leaning against a thick subway beam. "Ok, yea that's a good idea why not."

"Why not." I smiled.

"Why naut why naut..." she teased, as I half helped her up the steps.

We bought two coffees in a random greek diner and looked at eachother. Her head rolled around as she sobered up, all over the table and against the booth. She started bored and forced laughs, then eventually real ones. Her long nose and her straight dark hair betrayed her dead eyes.

"You work for a hedgefund."

"I work for a hedgefund" she grimaced.

"How do you like it?"

"It was all part of the plan."

"Your life plan?"

"My parents were fickle and wanted to abort me. So I decided to work at a hedgefund before I was born, hoping they'd catch wind of it."

On protests:
"The tastiest cocktail is the one on fire" (molotov cocktiel)



























After coughing a few times I answered.

"Hi Dad."

"How you doing sonny boy? How's the job?" he sounded high spirited. Almost happy.

"The job's fine Dad. Nothing new really. Working hard."

"Yes I know, same old story. Did you get your visa yet?"

"No," I said in anticipation, "I didn't get it yet." He knew I didn't, but wanted to take out any shred of doubt with every call.

"Well listen, I know you want to get it. It's been a long time, we've asked you for a year. We were all hoping you could come down so we can be together."

"I feel it's close Dad. But I can't leave the country until I get it."

"Yes son, I understand. Just it's hard since we won't see you. We wish you lived closer honestly."

I thought for a second, wondering if carefully placing my words was necessary. "it's hard for me too, I've been waiting more than a year and a half. But it's not something I can just leave, I need to finish it." I glanced around and spit in a gutter.

"It's a bad situations I know. Well if your job is good, and you feel you are going up to the next level, it will be worth it. Let me know if you can come soon, we will all be here end of summer in August."

"You will be the first to know when I get it. I won't forget."

"Alright son, it's really late here. You need anything? Ok. Take care."

"Yes Dad, love you." and I hung up.

There was a relaxed tension in our conversation. My family hadn't been fully together in years since I left. ((Knowing they were waiting pushed me to stay...))

My mother used to call me. Once a week I heard her thick Armenian accent telling me she misses me. She must miss us all, I said. My sister married, my brother out of the house. Our conversations became shallow slowly over the years, and soon enough they sounded like short words inscribed in code.
