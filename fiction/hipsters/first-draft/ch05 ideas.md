"How's Renee?"

"Yea she's not feeling too well tonight."

"Oh, what's wrong?"

"Well we don't know exactly but her mono is acting up again." I shifted in my seat uncomfortably. Our conversation breaks were laggy but not substantial.

The fruit flies hovered over the old juicer. It was Renee's present to me.

And suddenly I was in my apartment, sneaking a look at Renee saying Hi, but she didn't look up. I poured her latte into a glass and heated it up. Only half of it filled up the glass. Still she was completely embossed on the bed, engrossed.

"can you turn on the laundry again? I forgot to take out the clothes so they might have mold on them."

I immediately went back out, making sure the cat didn't escape. Just around the corner, under our bedroom window, I tilted Renee's forgotten latte dumping it in slow motion. The stream made a quick splash and settled in the cracks of concrete. Once the glass was ((fully)) empty, I lurched back up the stairs to the apartment.



(Completely forgot she ordered one.)
