"You know they why they want the peyote." said Renee, "For them to be more in tune, somehow a level up. A self betterment when it should be a selfless betterment to be more content, happy so you can help others."

It was many nights where I walked the streets with people holding up their umbrellas, all of them going in trickles on small streets or busting out of subways on the main ones spewing into the street. I watched the rain water go down the drain. Sometimes it overflowed but it all went down the drain. The point was lost.

I thought about it a lot. There is no counterpart to 'lonely'. It's implied that a person is naturally with other people. And in loneliness, there is a problem. Because no one is naturally lonely. 

When people got out of the city, like when I was hiking Qurnat as Sawda, the comfort is not that you are alone. Because the nature is there, you feel you aren't alone. You are small but you are not alone. There is always a comfort deep down that you are part of it, and they get out to remember that, whether they realize it or not. And there are no drains.

"How's Renee?"

"Yea she's not feeling too well tonight."

"Oh, what's wrong?"

"Well we don't know exactly but her mono is acting up again." I shifted in my seat uncomfortably. Our conversation breaks were laggy but not substantial.

The fruit flies hovered over the old juicer. It was Renee's present to me.

===============

And suddenly I was in my apartment, sneaking a look at Renee saying Hi, but she didn't look up. I poured her latte into a glass and heated it up. Only half of it filled up the glass. Still she was completely embossed on the bed, engrossed.

"can you turn on the laundry again? I forgot to take out the clothes so they might have mold on them."

I immediately went back out, making sure the cat didn't escape. Just around the corner, under our bedroom window, I tilted Renee's forgotten latte dumping it in slow motion. The stream made a quick splash and settled in the cracks of concrete. Once the glass was ((fully)) empty, I lurched back up the stairs to the apartment.



(Completely forgot she ordered one.)
