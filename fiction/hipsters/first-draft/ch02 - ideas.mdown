One thing Renee had were connections. Eventually she called up a mutual acquintance of hers, Jacob. Jacob worked for a shifty landlord owning a row of warehouses with offices above each of them. The rent was cheap and wasn't far from the subway. the move in together was quick but, there was a prevailing loneliness in my life. My attic apartment then, looking out on sidewalks where every night shadow creatures invaded and reminded me of the crime per neighborhood ratios. They took my aside and tried to reason with me. I'd lived through worse but the decision was obvious in the moment.

So Jacob helped us out. 


Unfortunately shortly after Jacob ignored saying hello to a harrassing high school gang they took offense and fractured his face with a rock. His entire philosophy of life shifted after doctors put a metal plate in his cheek. He re-examinined his existence and moved to a ranch in the mountains leaving Jack, Prof and eventually Andy keys to a huge skylighted room littered with sheet metal.
