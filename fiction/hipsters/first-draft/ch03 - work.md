CHAPTER 3

Every other day I woke up and shaved, tapping my razor handle against my hand to vomit out the hair. I used to tap the sink, but Renee heard it in her dreams.

"Fucking tap tap tap. I hate waking up to that shit. No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a giant razor to the floor.

After my toast I rubbed the smudge of peanut butter into my jeans and headed out while Renee slept. Her hours sat much later in the day than mine. She worked at an aryuvedic clinic deep in Greenpoint. When Renee was late or had mono once a week they accomodated her. benefits were the first few bottles and boxes of newly imported medicine. In between smoke breaks and relabeling expired medicine she'd call or text me about dinner or a movie or gossip. She used to bring home elixirs and herbs promising to revitalize our livers, iron to lighten our eyes, mud smoothies to clear out our digestion tracts. I tried them all but still felt pretty dirty. "You're hard to cleanse" she said.

Down to the limo receptionist below us for my daily ritual. She bore a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She'd hobble busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone three thousand miles away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight, and a huge grin that dangerously firted with tipping her over.

She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" she laughed hard.

Among the junk adverts the visa was absent, and I could feel the government silently shrug.

After climbing the stairs trying to avoid glaring ((staring?)) asses in front of me. The army of commuters dispersed. I followed my usual route to the 43rd street office and found a hulking Michael out front with a white stub between his fingers.

He was an interesting case. At six foot five the man spent his life chasing a medal in the olympic games, and he came out a world champion javelin thrower. After winning the gold he rejoiced. But four years later the world was looking for the next world champion thrower, so he decided to move on to a different challenge behind a desk punching keys with me. He also decided to take up the challenge of smoking, practicing twice daily.

"Hey Om."

"Good morning."

"Kind of late for morning."

"You know about the gym cruise?" I asked.

"Not really but I read about it."

"Some gym is advertising a buy in. It means free food and a ride around Liberty Island for whoever wants to hear a lecture on how great it'll be to pay hundreds of dollars a month to a gym you won't go to."

Michael itched his neck, "I think I've got to take care of my kid that night."

"You have to take care of your kid every night. A free something. Think about it. I don't want to go alone." 

"You're not taking your girl?"

"She won't go."

"That's kind of weird isn't it? Turning down a free cruise?" He puffed away looking out at the street.

"Let me know what you decide."

Michael sat across from me and Haven, the man who hired me, sat in an office closely behind us. The man was always smiling, well dressed and wore designer glasses. He came from a long line of Dutch fashioners, doctors and big businessers. He took me straight out of college, days before my graduation. He dolled out an offer and I accepted it immediately ((to stay in the country)).

I could feel the glare off the screen hit my eyes, ricocheting off them to some corner in the ceiling. Sales' phones would jerk us awake, if only for a bit.

"Can you come here for a second?" Haven sounded behind me.

The office stood as a monument to self gratification on the thirty second floor. Haven stood facing the street like a king, his hands in his pockets stupid dramatic.

"Hey Haven."

He glanced behind him, twisting his face getting his smile ready then put it on. "So how's it going?"

"It's alright." I said keeping eye contact. It was important I maintained eye contact.

"And work?"

"It's been fine, kind of slow."

"That's a funny, hmm, thats funny. Why do you think that is?"

I wondered if my face gave away my worry. Haven sensed it but kept watching me. He was only a few years older than me, which made him think he had an incredible power over me. He held his chin in his hand, then closed his eyes.

"I see you here, do you see yourself here longterm?"

"Yes of course I do."

Later I Slouched, staring at ((worshiping?)) my screen until the end of the day. Was super proud of that.











***






Nights were stay at home nights for Renee more or less. But once a month Renee invited some conspiritors over for a drum circle. A few natives combined with her friends sat around a huge frame drum with their respective clubs. Incense was lit, what sounded like hymnish things were sung. I was invited but kindly excused myself on those nights. It was interesting to find a clean apartment after coming back, at least the living room would be.

Renee had an eigthies romcom on while we picked up clothes. Selina interrupted it virtually with a hit me up for a coffee. "Hello fellow human!" She cheerfully gleed at me through the phone. Selina didn't think "you guys" made any feministic sense, so she always opted for "Hello kindly people" or "Greetings fellow homosapiens."

Renee kept glancing at me to ignore it but I answered anyway.

"Hey."

"You should come out." she whispered, "I'm at Cup O'Joe."

"At the coffee shop?"

"A cough-ee-shop?" I could hear her red face.

"Are you high?"

"I may be high. It is a definite possibility."

"I'll venture there then," and hung up.

I sacked on a pair of jeans, ignoring Renee's critical looks. "I need to go out." I told her, "I'm meeting up with Selina."

"You can't just leave, finish helping me out with cleaning?"

"I think you have it handled."

"You never stay. You never stay home anymore with me." Renee puttered. "Or are you meeting another girl to stay home with?"

"It'll only be until you're done. There is no other girl."

"Do you like Selina?"

"Please not again. Please."

She paused the film for a second "Can you get me an iced latte then? French roast."

"Sure."

I still can't count the number of times I walked up and down those streets. I could point to where I found ten dollars in change, where various throw up was spewed. Construction projects were laid out, miserably distorted around the blocks. I passed an oven was left to starve on the sidewalk, not before they stuffed it with empty bottles yet to be recycled.

((I remember that night distinctly because it was like any other night.)) The cold tried to creep into my jacket, into my pants. 

The down and out bars hid in the shadows behind car garages. Cool as they were, they served mac and cheese types of things, beer and little else. There were no windows so I couldn't see the people potentially dying from such a fire hazard inside. The two sushi places on the way I passed were idly populated. A bit further along, the projects were trying to project on to me, non discreet and brooding. The people who lived there almost all had projects. Brutal two day jobs, brutal childcare for their oh so many children and brutal laziness. Distanced, there were convenient stores far too expensive to be convenient. The arrangement was all a maze of zoning left over from a previous era.

A few girls sexilyed by me, some in tattered jeans, others in what looked like just shirts, shorts hidden in the midst. I was disgusted to think so, but hardly guilty. There was a Native American selling original symmetric artwork. She yelled twenty for each piece and I wondered if it was offensive that someone tried to talk her down to five.

At about that time I paced myself slower trying to time how late I'd be. I remember going in a haze, the buildings around me didn't exist as I stared at the ground or nothing. That's when I lifted a penny off the world and put the grimy thing in my pocket. This was money on the ground, pure value. Over the years I made quite a heap. Probably around sixty dollars. The change was all in a small jar. I never really felt I needed it though. It's the one thing I don't leave someone. Because no one wants the small, immediate minute pennies.

It was late but the dark cafe was still pretty active with many designers and artists slumped over tables and couches. Some yawned out conversations, others whooped mildly as they played cards or board games in corners. Each table had a giant pinecone on it.

Selina's eyes were at half mast with a very visible hazy red in their corners "I got high with Jeremy tonight." She gleamed.

"How's that going?" I concerned as bitterly as my gingerbread coffee.

"I don't know, what do you think of him?"

"I don't know him."

"He's a good guy, you'd like him." Every other word from Selina was lightly hurkled with a distant tired smile. "He's a university radio station coordinator. His friend works at Happy Blue Cat so we got to watch so many old documentaries. Rare ones about doctors in the sixties and bikes."

"Like stunt bikes?"

"All kinds of bikes. Hmm." And then, "Are you alright?"

"I'm totally fine. Absolutely nothing happened."

"How's Renee? She never comes out."

"Yea she's doing her drum circle tonight. The nativities."

Selina frowned at that. I pushed the envelope and the coffee mug against my cheek.

"What are you doing?"

"It keeps me warm. Warm cheekies. I don't even like coffee."

An eyebrow raised a chuckle, "then why order anything with coffee?"

"A latte is thicker so it'll keep me warmer."

The coffee was particularly strong, and since I very rarely drank coffee my head began to hurt. The milk was heavy and felt heavy going down, would be heavy on my way home and when I went to bed. And when I woke up the heaviness would be there to weigh down the rest of my day.

"Adrian's not working tonight looks like." I mentioned casually as I watched someone take a bit of avocado toast.

"She's playing tonight. At the Claybourne Whatever. It's the new place near Main and Clinton."

"Yea I heard about it. She plays a lot. You don't want to go? I'd totally be up for it."

She shrugged, "Kind of, but just wanted to take it easy tonight. Take it easy."

"Yea, me too", I said. "I started getting these weird spasms. My whole body would tense up for like a moment, then nothing."

((heart problems, kind of important part here, move to another section?))

"Oh my god is it a heart problem?! You never told me about this."

"I don't know but it sounds like a heart thing to me. I got checked up and they said they it's nothing they can find or detect, and that I shouldn't worry about it."

"You sure? Sounds serious."

"Yea, it's not a big deal they are rare and only last a second. But you can never be too sure."

Selina coughed and clutched her chest. Her fits were minor asthma leftover from her childhood. "So annyoing..."

"Heart problems maybe, not dangerous at all." I smiled at her, "let's be honest, who doesn't have problems with their heart? My mom is no exception." I said casually.

"Oh my god is your mom ok? I don't know anything about your mom."

"She's fine, they think it's something small ((would he say benign?)). Nothing to be worried about. ((why mention it then?))"

"You're dumping a lot of stuff on me tonight I don't know if I can mentally take it."

I looked around aimlessly. People worked away on their computers. Some were laughing, others sulking into their conversations.

"You see Gala at all?"

"No, why?"

"I don't know I started seeing her around more often. She comes here right?"

Selina started to look a bit frazzled. Upset wasn't quite the word, but her high was wearing off pretty quickly then.

"I don't understand why everyone wants to know about how Gala is. Is she so pretty? Or so interesting? She's cool but I have this conversation five times a week. I don't even talk to her that often at The Meatloaf."

Both Gala and Selina worked at a soup kitchen together every other week. It's how they met. They called it The Meatloaf because it was the main thing they served for the homeless. More recently they put an egg in the middle of the it so it would look fancier and save on the price of meat.

(("You know Meat loaf gets really made when people think his name is one word."

"Who would call themselves Meatloaf anyway? Why would you do that to yourself?" She forgot about Gala at that moment.))

On my way out I ordered Renee's latte. ((Selina's haze started to brighten up, ))

It was obviously the wrong topic in every way. I tried to change the subject, "I'm getting worried about my visa."

"Welcome to the world my friend." Selina raised her mug. "Where the proletariot never sleeps and we're drowning in our disappointment. It's us against it. We exist." she said dryly. "It's been a while though?"

"It's just so beauracratic. It's been a year and will probably take longer." I said, shrugging.

"Why don't you marry Renee?"

"I don't think we're quite there yet."

"So it's a commitment thing? Like responsibility stuff?"

I looked at Selina, "I think mentally we're not there yet. We both have our reservations."

She nodded again, licked her lips then nodded again.

((~~~~~Talk about playing in band where Om lights the guitar on fire))




((The conversation stopped)) We were done, obviously. I didn't feel like sitting another hour like that. My restlessness took me there, and soon enough took me outside with a wave.

The detour I took on my way back was long. I went through a village of modern apartments complexes, still deserted. Apartments that were half finished had already been bought. The concreate jutted to the sky. I wondered for a moment what it was like to live on the top floor, to live on any floor. Soon there'll be rich toddlers. There'll be yoga pants. There'll be dogs running around everywhere here too. Dogs. My coworkers would love these places. The Basterdized Bauhaus practically laughing at them, I can almost hear it. The same sky's they'd be under has been around longer than birds, but to the new residents it'll be a nice touch and a simple distraction from what they really needed to do to need to do.

But what makes a city? People. What were the people doing on the sixty seventh floor, what happened in the basement on the third Wednesday night of every month. What opened, what closed, who was creating something beautiful? These were some enlightned mother fuckers, right? That's what I thought. Worldly people. You know before I moved I heard the city did something to you. You know. But what I found concrete with garages or delis on every other corner... I was still there and I didn't find anything.

I leaned against a giant metallic bird statue only a larger metallic mother bird statue could love. Renee's latte felt only faintly warm in my hands as I sipped it. I looked up and tried to find a star while under the street lamps but they glared far too much.

Trying to calm down, I hummed a soft sylable in a bass, my eyes still closed, forgetting the world. I could still hear the wind so I tried to shut it out. And the street cars. And the silence. I thought about what I was looking for.

A couple walked by me holding hands like people who still held hands. They were deftly upsetting and rearranged my stomach accordingly. And the latte was cold now and getting colder and wondered where it was, so I had to save it.

Honestly you were just there, and I loved you. But really, we grew apart just like I grew apart. You were cautious and protective and it horrified me for a long time. That's the closest I can give to an explanation.

The straight silent street led me back. The light was on in Jack and Andy's apartment. A fever of rage suddenly surfaced. Who was Andy. Such a bastard. I wanted to tear off his limbs and beat him with them.

When I entered the apartment Renee and her friends Ethan and Marley were talking to an elder native named Farmer's Son. I gave a nod in their direction as I headed to the kitchen. They waved and nodded back but Farmer's Son had them pegged at something in their conversation that drew them in. I tried not to overhear them and shuffled around, but in a small apartment there were no secrets.

"I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do." Farmer's Son said.

"How many more times at the sweat lodge would it take?" Ethan asked.

"It's not a simple thing to take. I'm sure you can find a way without me."

Renee chimed in, "but we've been practicing pyote for years here. I've been twice already."

Farmer's Son ((rename, were not farmers)) "Let me be honest with you." he said, his low voice sounding tired, "This is very deep. You don't need me to introduce you to anyone ((for ayahuesca)). But it's not my place to advocate for it on behalf of you. You have to understand, I can't advocate on behalf of the tourists. Hat is what they see you as."

"It is though!" Renee said emphatically.

"Respectfully, I'm sorry. Again, thank you for holding this."

I barely heard the echo of him going down the stairs while Renee discussed something with Ethan and Marley as they left.

"He called us tourists." Ethan told Renee, everything wiped off his face.

"We are not tourists." Marley reiterated.

=============

What was that about? I asked


=============

Soon enough, she waved them off and sounded out a goodbye to me. Renee went to lie on her bed from there, disappointed and ignoring me turning on a movie.

"Can you turn on the laundry again? I forgot to take out the clothes so they might have mold on them." She called out.

"Yea, sure."

I immediately went outside and shut the door carefully, making sure the cat didn't escape. Just around the corner, under our bedroom window, I dumped Renee's forgotten cold latte in slow motion. The stream made a quick splash and settled in the cracks of concrete. It was ((fully)) empty, and soon I lurched back upstairs.



















"Hey Gala?" I spoke softly, almost whispered. A whisper you'd use to wake someone up, then gently hold her hand and press it just a bit so her body could acclumate ((enter? adjust?)) back to reality.

She breathed a dreamy "Yea?" when she answered, her voice about to float away.

The I don't know what I said. Words spilled into the receiver, a mess of a place. "There's a thing on Thursday night" and "" were somewhere in there. I wasn't sure if I made sense. Maybe I sounded too eager. I let the words hang in the air, sick and deliberate.

"What? Ok sure. I don't work that night. Sounds fun."
