Dialogue for his thoughts




CHAPTER 3

Every other day I woke up and shaved, tapping my razor handle against my hand to vomit out the hair. But it began to sneak into Renee's dreams. "Fucking tap tap tap. I hate waking up to that shit. No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a giant razor to the floor.

After my toast I rubbed the smudge of peanut butter into my jeans and headed out while Renee slept.
((reword, peanut butter on finger. More visual))

 Her hours sat much later in the day than mine. She worked at an ayurvedic clinic deep in Greenpoint. When Renee was late or had mono once a week they accommodated her. Benefits were the first few bottles and boxes of newly imported products. In between smoke breaks and relabeling expired medicine she'd call or text me about dinner or a movie or gossip. She used to bring home elixirs and herbs promising to revitalize our livers, iron to lighten our eyes, mud smoothies to clear out our  tracts.

"You're hard to cleanse" she said.

Down to the limo receptionist below us for my daily ritual. ((Rephrase))

Besides her sarcastic demeanor she bore a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She'd hobble busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone three thousand miles away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight, and a huge grin that dangerously flirted with tipping her over.

She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" she laughed hard.

Among the junk adverts the visa was absent, and I could feel the government silently shrug.

Downtown I climbed the subway stairs emerging for air, trying to avoid the army of commuters' glaring asses in front of me. 
((reword, show how he's feeling and his insecurities and distrubances by them. Flagarant.

Maybe try:
"Glaring at me"?))


I followed my usual route to the forty third street office and found a hulking Kevin out front with a white stub between his fingers.

He was an interesting case. We coded together since I joined. At six foot five the man spent his life chasing a medal in the olympic games, and he came out a world champion javelin thrower. After winning the gold he rejoiced. But four years later the world was looking for the next champion thrower, so he decided to move on to a different challenge behind a desk programming, punching keys with me. He also decided to take up the challenge of smoking, practicing twice daily with ones he rolled himself.

"Hey Om."

"Good morning."

"Kind of late for morning." His gaze was locked down the long valley thick with cars and sidewalk, a lost look in his eyes.

"You know about the gym cruise?" I asked.

"Not really but I read a bit about it."

"Some gym is advertising to buy in and they want to impress people. So it means free food and a boat around Liberty Island for whoever wants to hear a lecture on how great it'll be to pay hundreds of dollars a month to a place they won't go to."

Kevin itched his neck, "I think I've got to take care of my kid that night."

"You have to take care of your kid every night. A free something. Think about it. I don't want to go alone." 

"You're not taking your girl?"

"She won't go."

"That's kind of weird isn't it? Turning down a free cruise?" He puffed away.

"Let me know what you decide."

Up, through the elevator. A keycard swipe. Crashing at my desk. I could feel the dull light off the screen hit my eyes then ricocheting to some corner in the ceiling. Sales phones were picked up and thrown down a few feet away jerking us awake all day, but only for a bit.

Haven, the man who hired me, sat in an office close behind us. The man was always smiling, well dressed and wore designer glasses. He came from a long line of Dutch fashioners, doctors and big businessers. He plucked me straight out of my college days before graduation and reeled me in with an offer.

Haven must have seen me come in. After I sat down he sounded behind me "Can you come here for a second?"

On cue he stood facing the street like a king, his hands in his pockets stupid dramatic. He stood as a monument to self gratification on the thirty second floor. 

I could feel the glare off the screen hit my eyes, ricocheting off them to some corner in the ceiling. Sales' phones would jerk us awake, if only for a bit.

"Hey Haven."

He glanced behind him, twisting his face, getting his smile ready. "So how's it going?"

"It's alright." I said keeping, eye contact. It was important I maintained eye contact.

"And work?"

"It's been fine, kind of slow."

"That's a funny, hmm, that's funny. Why do you think that is?"

Did my expression give me away? Haven sensed it but kept watching me. He was only a few years older, which made him think he had an incredible power over me. He held his chin in his hand, then closed his eyes.

"You'll let me know if anything is wrong at home, at work, anything right?"

My words escaped me, "Yes of course."

Later when I came out Michael was already back. He nodded at me and I threw him a salute. Until the end of the day I worshiped the screen. Was super proud of that.

***

Nights were stay at home nights for Renee more or less. But every other week she invited some conspirators over for a drum circle. 
((maybe explain better why its clean or the situation more?))


A few natives combined with her friends sat around a huge frame drum with their respective clubs. Incense was lit and what sounded like hymnish things were sung. I was invited but kindly excused myself on those nights. It was interesting to find a clean apartment after coming back, at least the living room was. Renee had an eigthties romcom on while we put away clothes, a great change of pace.

An hour in though, Selina interrupted us virtually with a hit me up for a coffee. Renee kept glancing at me but I answered anyway.

"Hello fellow human!" She cheerfully sang into the phone. Selina didn't think "you guys" made any feministic sense, so she always opted for "Hello kindly people" or "Greetings fellow homosapiens."

"Hey."

"You should come out." she whispered, "I'm at Cup O'Joe."

"At the coffee shop?"

"A cough-ee-shop?" I could hear her red red face.

"Are you high?"

"I may be high. It is a definite possibility."

"I'll venture then," and hung up.

I sacked on a pair of jeans, ignoring Renee's critical looks. "I need to go out." I told her, "I'm meeting up with Selina."

"You can't just leave, finish helping me out with cleaning."

"I think you have it handled."

"You never stay. You're never home with me anymore." Her lip pouted, "Or are you meeting another girl to stay home with?"

"It'll only be until you're done. There is no other girl."

"Do you like Selina?"

"Please not again. Please."

She paused her film "Can you get me an iced latte then? French roast."

"Sure."

The cold tried to creep into my jacket, into my pants. The streets were an old story. I could point to where I found ten dollars in change, where various throw up was spewed. Construction projects were laid out, a miserable mess around each block. An oven was left to starve on the sidewalk, the empty bottles that stuffed it taken by the homeless ghosts of the night.

The down and out bars hid in the shadows behind car garages or narrow halls and nooks, all made of oaks and cedar. Cool as they were, they served mac and cheese types of things, beer and little else. There were no windows so I couldn't see the people potentially dying from a fire hazard inside.

At about that time I paced myself slower trying to time how late I'd be. Puttering in a light haze, the buildings around me didn't exist as I stared at the ground or nothing. That's when I lifted a penny off the world and put the grimy thing in my pocket. Over the years I made quite a heap. Probably around sixty dollars. I never really felt I needed it though. No one wants the small, immediate, minute pennies. But I did.

It was late but the dark cafe was still pretty active with designers and artists slumped over all the tables  and couches. Some yawned out conversations, others whooped as they played cards or board games in corners. Each table had a giant pinecone on it.

Selina's eyes were at half mast with a skin of red fog over each "I got high with Jeremy tonight." She gleamed.

"How's that going?" I was as concerned as my gingerbread coffee was bitter.

"I don't know, what do you think of him?"

"I don't know him."

"He's a good guy, you'd like him." She hurkled every other word with a distant tired smile. "He's a university radio station coordinator. His friend works at Happy Blue Cat so we got to watch so many old documentaries. Rare ones about doctors in the sixties and bikes."

"Like stunt bikes?"

"All kinds of bikes." She slumped, "Are you alright?"

"I'm totally fine. Absolutely nothing happened."

"How's Renee? She never comes out."

I slumped"Yea she's doing her drum circle tonight. The nativities."

Selina shrugged. I pushed the envelope and the coffee mug against my cheek.
((maybe too playful turn of phrase))


"What are you doing?"

"It keeps me warm. Warm cheekies. I don't even like coffee."

An eyebrow raised a hardy chuckle in her, one I was all too used to "then why order anything with coffee?"

"A latte is thicker so it'll keep me warmer."

It was particularly strong, and since I rarely drank coffee my head began to hurt. The milk was thick and felt heavy going down, would be heavy on my way home and when I went to bed. And when I woke up the heaviness would be there to weigh me down the rest of my day.

A weird swallowed a bite of avocado toast. Looking over at the register I let drop, "Adrian's not working tonight looks like."

"She's playing tonight. At the Claybourne Whatever. It's the new place near Main and Clinton."

"Yea I heard about it. She plays a lot. You don't want to go? I'd totally be up for it."

Selina winced, "Kind of, but I just wanted to take it easy tonight. Take it easy."

"Yea, me too", we sat with the silence,  "I started getting these weird spasms. My whole body would tense up for like a moment, then nothing."

"Oh my god is that a heart problem?! You never told me about this."

"I don't know but it sounds like a heart thing to me. I got checked up and they said it's nothing they can find or detect, and that I shouldn't worry about it."

"You sure? Sounds serious."

"Yea, it's not a big deal they are rare and only last a second. But you can never be too sure."

Selina coughed and clutched her chest. Her fits were minor asthma leftover from her childhood. "So annyoing..."

"Heart problems maybe, not dangerous at all." I smiled at her, "let's be honest, who doesn't have problems with their heart? My mom is no exception." I said forcing a smile.

"Oh my god is your mom ok? I don't know anything about your mom."

"She's fine, my dad says it's something small. Nothing to be worried about."

"You're dumping a lot of stuff on me tonight I don't know if I can mentally take it."

People worked away on their computers. Some were laughing, others sulking in their conversations.

"You see Gala at all?"

"No, why?"

"I don't know I started seeing her around more often. She comes here right?"

Selina shook her hair in a hard itch. Upset wasn't quite the word, but her high was wearing off pretty quick then.

"I don't understand why everyone wants to know about how Gala is. Is she so pretty? Or so interesting? She's cool but I have this conversation five times a week. I don't even talk to her that often at The Meatloaf."

Both Gala and Selina worked at a soup kitchen together every other week. It's how they met. They called it The Meatloaf because it was the main thing they served for the homeless. More recently they put an egg in the middle of the it so it would look fancier and save on the price of meat.

Continuation of chapter 3. Am looking to if this scene moves too fast and what should I elaborate on if it does. A reminder that Ethan and Marley were introduced already in chapter 2. I’m also wondering if you’re feeling Om’s loneliness along with everyone else’s.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I looked beyond our reflections in the store glass. The still bitter night outside offered little solace to the people that surrendered to it. Passerbys whooped laughs and flung arms around each other in rough embraces.

"I'm getting worried about my visa."

"No surprise!" Selina circled the mouth of her mug with her finger, "Welcome to the world my friend. Where the proletariat never sleeps and we're drowning in disappointment. It's us against them." Her eyelids hung low as she debated . "It's been a while though? That's a good thing right?"

"It's just so bureaucratic. It's been a year and a half and will probably take longer. I'm so restless."

Selina took a big sip. "Why don't you marry Renee?"

"Like that's an option."

"Isn't it? You've been together for a while."

"I don't think we're quite there yet. I think mentally we're not there yet. We both have our reservations."

Selina licked her lips then nodded.

The little squeals from every corner, the tiny hacked laughs of the each booth, the exhausted huffing of the coffee machine was all a steady kind of water torture. We were done, obviously. It was impossible to sit another hour brooding on my luck. My wandering mind took me away from the table with a few more words and a wave. Selina's high triggered a shotty smirk and peace sign. On my way out I took Renee's latte, and my mission ended.

The long detour I took on my way back went through a village of a modern half finished apartment complex. Some waiting for the paint to dry, some already bought. The concrete buildings jutted to the sky, each pillar a middle finger to whatever stood there before it. The bastardized Bauhaus laughed at us. I sat trying to find a star under the bright street lamps, but of course there were none.

So under a giant metallic bird statue only a larger metallic mother bird statue could love, I closed my eyes. I hummed a long syllable in a bass to forget the world.

But you crept in my mind and I loved you. You were cautious and protective and it horrified me for a long time. That's the closest thing I can give to an explanation.

And still I heard the wind rustling loose dust, cars in the distance shouting, the silence of the city so loud it hurt to sit still. A couple walked by me holding hands like people who still held hands. They were deftly upsetting and rearranged my stomach accordingly. The latte had no warmth left and getting colder so I had to save it.

Some stupid street led me back. The light was on in Jack and Andy's apartment. A fever of rage in me suddenly surfaced. Who was Andy. Such a bastard. I wanted to tear off his limbs and beat him with them.

The smell of sage took over the apartment. Renee and her friends Ethan and Marley were talking to an elder native named Pontiac's Son. I gave a nod in their direction as I headed to the kitchen. They waved and nodded back but Pontiac's Son had them pegged at something in their conversation that drew them in. I shuffled around making noise, but in such a small apartment there were no secrets.

"I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do." Pontiac's Son said.

"How many more times at the sweat lodge would it take?" Ethan asked.

"It's not a simple thing to take. I'm sure you can find a way without me."

Renee chimed in, "but we've been practicing ayahuasca for years here. I've been twice already."

Pontiac's Son lowered his voice, but it only made him sound tired. "Let me be honest with you. This is very deep. You don't need me to introduce you to anyone. But it's not my place to advocate for it. You have to understand, I can't advocate on behalf of tourists. That is what they see you as."

"It is though!" Renee said emphatically.

"Respectfully, I'm sorry. Again, thank you for holding this."

The door shut, and the three waited a few moments until they erupted.

"He called us tourists." Ethan told Renee, everything wiped off his face.

"We are not tourists." Marley reiterated.

They went on for five more minutes before they said their goodbyes to me and Renee. And soon enough when they were out the door Renee waved them off, plopping onto her bed with a movie on soon.

"Can you turn on the laundry machine? I forgot to take out the clothes this morning so wash them again in case they get mold on them." She called.

"Ok.” I said. But from a window I watched the last of the cars sluggishly leave, with Ethan a careful driver. No walkers left in sight. Only the lurking limos in the parking lot remained, sleeping sharks. 

I immediately snuck outside and shut the door carefully, making sure the cat didn't escape. Just around the corner from the stairs, under our bedroom window, holding Renee's latte, I dialed.

"Hey Gala?" I spoke softly, a whisper you'd use to wake someone you love up with. One where afterwards, you’d gently hold their warm hand and press it just a bit so they could acclimate back to reality.

She breathed a dreamy "Yea?” into the receiver.

“Gala?”

She hummed a sleepy “Om?" A voice about to float away.

Then I don't know what I said. Words spilled out and threw themselves together in a complete mess. "There's a thing on Thursday night" and "we’re somewhere in there.” I wasn't sure if I made sense. Maybe I sounded too eager. I let the words hang in the air, sick, forward and deliberate. “A cruise around Manhattan. Cheap fun. Drinks. Something."

"What? Yea. I don't work that night. Yea. Sounds fun."

“It’ll be fun.” I confirmed.

“Thursday then. See you.”

((bad paragraph intro?)) In the cold concrete desert night I dumped Renee's cold latte in slow motion. The stream made a quick splash and settled in the cracks, a tiny lost river. And when it was empty, I lurched back upstairs.
