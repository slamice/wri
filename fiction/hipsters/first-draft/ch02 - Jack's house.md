CHAPTER 2

Years before on the way to a party I stared out a foggy subway car window. Riding through the New York underground was like dropping yourself in a hole. Our car screamed at the tunnel creatures stirring as we ran down the tracks and cut sharp corners. The beams still stood sooted like in a crypt.  Soon came the howling of another train, emerging from the void just as panicked. The two traveled in the same direction floating together, slowly showcasing each of their passengers. All the riders' passive faces hung low as they stared off into different corners of their cars. I understood we all did this to avoid being labeled a voyeur, but I was always curious at what I'd catch.

I recognized Andrew, a tall lanky hook nose from my university English classes. We were migrating to the same party, I usually saw him at those.

But in that same moment was my first glimpse of Renee. Very decent shoulder length black hair framed her round face perfectly. It was the brightest thing that shown through those disgusting windows. Andrew stood in front of her, his huge flat hands flying into wild gestures while her tiny mouth laughed. You could tell her teeth were sharp for a vegan.

Right before her train ripped itself off our route she glanced back at me. Her mouth curled into a smile as I watched them both disappear. That smile lingered in me, and I made a slow retreat from the train, savouring whatever I'd seen.

The leaning party we arrived at took place fenced off welding garage in east Bushwick. You could hear the music blasting blocks away like a prayer call. Inside were food food trucks and stands built from crushed frames. Car seats littered the lot and that's where we did the majority of our leaning.

Conversations there were hefty doses of unreality. I joined a few randoms and we philosophized who worked where in the city, really, and what that entailed.

Non-profit radio station manager.

Animal shelter.

In between jobs.

Not an artist but something.

Has no work plans.

I'm sure even those answers felt betrayed. Because these people had their words seep out of their mouths slowly. Some leaked like drool embarrassingly, others crawled out like spiders once a lip flap was open. Most were unamused by their words, happier to have to explain how small their apartment rooms were in attics and comfortable their friends' couches were.

I found Andrew and Renee at a trailer bar. Andrew's clothes paled to Renee bold shirt yelling "Zentitled" in bold rainbow colors. She introduced herself with a smile, and her lip curl hooked me in again. She didn't absolutely exude beauty but the light in her brown eyes, the curve of her halfie face. Sure, whatever, yeah. It all made sense to fall in love with her. And we discussed the facts.

Andrew bemused over a few philosophies on life he was saving for a while. Renee listened quietly through it all. But once he finished she became animated. The air of her control over the conversation intrigued me. She held tightly onto her confidence and it was impressive, almost powerful. I wondered how lucky Andrew was or how desperate Renee was to find a tall guy.

"So how long have you lived here?" Renee asked ((with a genuine routine in her voice)).

"It's been six years. I got my diploma, working in the city now."

"You like the States?"

"I feel like I've been here all my life." It took most of my life to get to that soldering garage party. "You?"

"No, I moved here a while ago, maybe three years. But I love it. I love it all."

We looked out at the aimless groups. In the corner of the lot some were setting up a projector with fold out chairs. It was unclear what the movie was going to be, but my guess was one of those films that run forever with a man sleeping, or someone sanding a piece of wood.

She rolled up her sleeve to scratch her elbow and I asked "Is that a birthmark on your arm?"

"No, it's a bruise." she said, balancing the cigarette in her mouth.

"How'd you get that?"

"I got it through living life. It's a lifemark. You get it through experience, not when you're being born." 

She puffed out, smiling. I could feel the hook tug tighter at my cheek.

We started hanging out more. I'd swing by her place when she was alone, which was often. Andrew would be on a drug errand or something for days while we'd go out and have coffee, sometimes even dinner. I'm not sure what I was getting at, honestly.

After she broke up with Andrew plus a week or two, we started these long walks across Brooklyn. On them she dumped everything she knew on me, but not her memoir exactly. She lived off dollar vegetables she bought in chinatown for months. Cockroaches crawled on her lips at night in her closet apartment when she slept. Her father never loved her. All of it. Curated battles and life mysterions. She was beautiful, was struggling regardless of how, and had been through hard to harder times.

Her landlord, a nice older Malaysian man, did her a courtesy and taped an eviction notice to her door. You could hear the thin glue let go as she tore off the paper.

"What do I do with this?" She asked me in a hushed tone.

"I don't think he needs it back."

"I'll have to move back to the midwest. To North Salem back in with my Mom."

"You'll be spared the common decency of New York then."

"You want me to move back Om?"

I pretended to think about it, but knew I wanted her to stay. So we had to find a way. My room in Ridgewood couldn't fit another thing, so I had to grow up a little.

Finally after a frantic few weeks a friend of Renee's talked to his shifty landlord. He rented us an office above a limo dispatch by a recycling plant, breaking multiple zoning laws. The corner of Bushwick was soon scuffed when Andy moved block down. I wasn't too concerned about common decency though. Only a bit further down were high rises and cafe's where the rich purged their money. We could escape anytime and didn't have to go anywhere near the disgruntled memories.

***

Renee and I walked back to our makeshift apartment when we saw a light was on ahead of us. Since we moved in we hadn't visited Jack and his friends. I hadn't seen him since the dance party. He lived with Andy and Prof. If you're wondering then yes, Prof is not his real name. The change was because he had one only slightly more embarrassing.

"We should at least stop by to visit them."

"I mean maybe Jack but that's it. Just _avoid_ Andrew. Why am I supposed to see him?"

"Because he's still my friend-" Renee said, stammering.

"He used to beat you." I said sharply, "I just don't understand why you'd want anything to do with him."

"Yea but that's old! That was ages ago. I mean he used to get really mad but he's getting in a better place. He's moving to a BETTER PLACE in his life. Can't you see that?"

We walked underneath their window and before another protest Renee yelled up for Andrew. From the second floor Jack's sleepy face poked out, and sleepier voice yelled down "Yeah he's here. Come up!". Jack's girlfriend, a squirrelly girl named Sarah came down to open the door, her hair a bushel and her front teeth just slightly bucked.

I could have walked off but Gala's memory tapped me on my shoulder, reminding me she needed me. She was hungry and cold, shivering in a fraying sweater. So I followed them up holding a blank face in front of my own. The wooden stairs creaked as we carefully climbed them.

Andy's apartment was a desolate. He frowsted with Jack and Prof in a huge room. Each of the three bedrooms were quarantined off with shower curtains. The ceiling was low. Anyone taller than six feet could only stand upright in the very middle of the apartment under one of two windows, the skylight. It was a bit hard to imagine the place designed for anything but a mess. Littered on the floor were Prof's coffee mugs and cappuccino cups. Jack's paints were next to them with beer bottles, cigarette trays complete with ash, nails and chipped wood. Signs of Andrew were everywhere but his main manifest was a pile of philosophy and spiritual books. The lighting, as with all of the lighting within the industrial area we lived in, was a depressing fluorescent.

There was barely a kitchen thrown off to the side. A tossed lopsided fridge in a corner. A cutting board sat on the counter with a cleaver sticking straight up out of it. "For cutting cheese," Sarah whispered when she caught me glimpse at it. The inhabitants loafed around unapologetically, eyes a tad hazy.

There was art. Jack's work lined the walls and floor underneath. Lots of paintings. A desert with a naked woman standing by a cactus, a mesh of naked women spewing out of a drain. A pair of boobs floating in the sky. Different chairs were painted various hues, one had a tv glued to its seat with a portrait of a seagull. These things came to Jack casually, painted with pastels and cigarette smoke. I hadn't seen Jack's latest art in a while. 

"Which one do you like?" Jack scratched at his hands, a bit dry and peeling.

"Where do your ideas come from?" I asked.

"Sometimes in my sleep, sometimes they creep up on me. Sometimes they come to me like a locomotive." He stood proud of remembering something he considered archaic to use.

"I like this one", his girlfriend Sarah yawned out a whine. She pointed to a painting with a woman wearing no pants, in fact nothing but a tiny t-shirt that said "NO cooking". She rode a horse into space.

Jack also covered the walls with masses of text and melting heads. Quotes from Burroughs and Ginsberg were scribbled, smeared and softened. Some of the text was attached to torsos and huge brains that looked suspended in midair. It's as if someone sipped some ink and spat on the walls repeatedly. Pollack chewing, drooling tobacco in disgust, rubbing his face in it. "Irregular atmosphere, timid and reluctant" was written in one corner. "Art space for drunks" was written in another.

Behind us Prof's shadow danced loudly against one of the curtains as he rummaged through a box of tools.

These were all horrible distractions that only dug into me more. But an incredible fucking waste of time, Andrew, sat on the floor, rolling a joint on a crate. He licked his fingers and pressed them against the thin paper. His sockets were deep in his face, naturally born that way, sunken like battleships. He always looked either sad, indifferent or angry. Renee explained used to explain thet he was missing something and never found it. That something was probably his unborn twin, dead in the womb. He could never forget the memories he never had with his brother. His parents were worried he'd go through the rest of his life with regret. And it was true, it was true it was true.

"So what are you doing these days Andy?" Renee asked him cheerfully.

Andrew rubbed the joint between his fingers, responding casually without looking up at her, "I'm working up at Mugga Joe, also working on the film script with Ethan and Marley. We're sharing some of the dialogue and there's a big funeral scene with a eulogy. That's all I can say really."

Ethan and Marley came by picking up Renee a few times to practice ayahuasca in a forest. They puked the whole night together, calling it purging. Marley painted pictures of flowers and giggled every other word. Ethan was involved in two huge children's productions that made them well off for a while. They both wrote scripts for hollywood that couldn't make it past the noses of producers. But this time it was their movie, probably about something holistic and ethereal like Super Yoga.

Andrew shifted all over the floorboards and lit. The marijuana smoke trailed up and swirled above his head in a halo. He took a loud sip before handing it over to Jack. Sarah turned it down, but watched attentively.

"That's exciting!" Renee said with a huge grin, over-emphatically "I'm super happy for you! A movie, it really sounds like you're going places Andy!"

"Jack's in it too actually. He got a part as the protagonist's friends." Jack nodded in agreement. Sarah stared at Jack then off into a corner.

"Oh really?!" Renee squealed. "I didn't know they'd invite so many people on this, they were pretty secretive about it."

Jack muttered in, "Yea they had auditions and yeeeeaaaa I can do that." but then he turned his attention to me, "Long time no see, so how's it going?" he patted me on the back, "How was the party?"

"Normal, usual."

"Are you still working at the, what... The software thing? place?" Sarah asked out of nowhere.

"Yea I'm still there."

"Well do you like it?" Sarah feigned interest.

"Yea it's alright, I don't know. I don't really like everything about my work."

"But is it FUN?" Jack looked hard at me. I was a bit surprised at how serious his tone was suddenly.

"Yea it's ok, I like programming I guess." I tried not to look at Andy. His presence made me uncomfortable, in fact the whole situation did.

"I guess you can make a lot of good money but it's pretty menial work. I talked to Matt, he's not too into it." and then Jack went on and on.

Jack must have felt the weird tension? How often did something like this occur, lovers of the past and present fighting it out with passive aggressive blows. Andy and I hadn't talked in months. Our last conversation, typical of Andy, was how the universe was expanding but could barely accommodate anyone even though the people in it were dying. He was sullen, apathetic at first glance, nothing unusual. But I'm sure it *dug* deep into him.

I headed to the corner to a few of Jack's Kerouac novels, mail and records piled on the ground.  I started flipping through them to feel busy, mostly 80's new wave or early 90's American noise rock. Past The Microphones and the Camper Van Beehtovens, The Greens and The Talking Heads reissues. All their jackets felt creased, worn and tired.

I eyed the mail quickly, and under some final sales and subscriptions was an unassuming letter, one with Gala's name on it. Before confirming the others were busy with the nothing they were doing I folded and back pocketed it. The heart thumping was a great addition to the already uneasiness in my chest.

Renee was talking with Andy excitedly again about nothing in particular, in this case her mother.

"- and she's still at that house. Do you remember when you snuck in to wait for me?"

"Yea, I remember her look."

Jack intervened, "Wait, I never heard this. So what happened, he broke in?"

Then I thought I saw Renee give Andy a potential flirt, maybe not living up to its fullest but it was definitely made available. I sat there questioning its authenticity when she answered.

"He climbed in through the window because he thought I was asleep but I was out then getting rolling papers. So he waited in the bathtub because he was ridiculous, not expecting my Mom to come back that weekend and walk through the door. I think she was at some kind of 'Start Your Business' seminar."

"She didn't like it." Andy's voice crept in at the tail end on top of Renee's.

"You were crazy for doing that! You were _crazy_. She was pretty crazy too. I'm sure I told you I used to wait for her for hours after school for her to pick me up. People worried about me then. She was always running errands."

She went on. How Andy could use a new type of herbal medication. How she'd woken up sick with a rash on her face down to her arm, bed struck and unable to go work.

With all of this Prof brooded in the shadows not saying anything, and I could his silhouette putting on some black blurry headphones.

I waited cross legged against a wall and watched. Even with the art, the flex-rooms, the smoke, dust, dirt and the people, the room still felt so empty. If you winked you weren't sure they were there. Like nothing was sure to exist in this space.

After some twenty more minutes , I signaled to Renee I was leaving. She waved that she'd catch up with me in a few minutes, but got up anyway. I took a quick last look at Andy.  He noticed, got up in fact, and in front of us all he looked me in the eye and said, "I forgive you" smiling, and shook my hand. I shook back blandly and headed towards the stairs, ignoring the glances.

"You can come back and visit." Jack sleepily waved. The rest of the goodbyes procrastinated until we were out the door.

"Andy's changed! He's got a job and his life is getting stable. He's doing better," Renee was excited, almost blushing.

"Why do you care about someone who beat you?"

"He's a part of my life. You have to accept that. I've known him for so long."

And she tried to bring me back, "Hey! Come on! Don't worry of course I still love you. I'm with _you_ now! Come on!"

I made a shut up smile. We walked back slowly in silence to the limo office, the only sound was Renee's inner thighs rubbing against each other wearing down her jeans.

I took a deep breath as we went up the staircase, feeling my heart finally settle. Just before we entered the apartment I stopped. "I'm going to the store for a bit, by the guitar shop."

"Can you get me cigarettes?"

"I'm not buying you cigarettes."

"Why not?"

"Don't you have enough?"

He face screwed up, "Hey I'm cutting back. Why are you watching me so close anyway? Shouldn't you be worried about yourself? You're just bones Om. How about you eat more?"

I shut the door and trudged off, signalling Gala. To my surprise she agreed to come immediately since she was only minutes away. We agreed to meet down a few streets near an alley a few families of crows owned, far enough from the general direction of our friends and enemies.

I waited on one of those large open pipes that jutting out of the sidewalk under a motion activated light, massaging my face in my hands. My heart settled down my gullet again only to fly back out.

Who I saw under the light was a different person. Gala's face lit the whole block and held a tenderness I hadn't noticed before. The brown wavy locks, her hands pocketed in her tight black jacket. And the freckles.

"You got the money?"

Her horrible imitation of a shady hooligan said, "Yea I got your money if you got the stuff" and she laughed. Her teeth shown bare, her mouth showcasing the pearls like an infomercial.

"You living with anyone right now?"

"Yea, I'm bunking with a friend. You know Ming?"

We were like that for a few moments waiting for an answer while we silently watched each other.

"No, I don't know Ming," then I dared, "how long is this fight with Prof gonna last, or is it quits?"

The joy on her face crawled back inside herself, but blush remained on her cheeks. "I'd rather not talk about that."

"I really hope you enjoy the eighty seven or so dollars in change from the unemployment office." 

"It's a hundred something." She looked down the empty street and her shoulders fell. "It can't buy me anything, but it's the thought that counts."

I reached back and suddenly Gala was a careful watcher. The hand to my pocket, pocket to the envelope, envelope to her hand, eyes to my face. She sounded out thank you in a voice so sincere it must have been practiced. Then she drifted off over the warehouses, barely missing a streetlight. She floated over the buildings and spiked concrete, her angel wings almost catching on a flagpole, over the east river, back into the sky where she came from. I held my breath until she was gone from sight then inhaled the winter back in, marching single file back to my apartment a new slave.
