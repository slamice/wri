Chapter 4

I walked to some forgotten corner of Murray Hill until I hit the FDR hugging the East River. There was nothing but a grey desert of concrete with modern shanties by the water, their boats faithfully hiding behind them. Our cruise boat was lolling back and forth trying to soothe itself before we stepped on board. The queue for it already had pre-gamer casual suits and skirts schmoozing. Some hid bottles in their bags and coats, unable to wait for the open bar onboard. 

Heaving from side to side, the floating dock was a stupor to contend with. Michael bailed on me hard, which wasn't a surprise. Gala promised to be there too, but I didn't spot her among the crowd. Ages and styles varied wildly. The expressions and colors in the older people’s faces were drained from conversing of a life of tans and cocktails. The younger crowd was vivid, each member giggling but unsure. Tipsy, they all wrestled with basic facts, looking out over at civilization and the neighboring waters that separated them.

As we climbed on board each was  knighted with a plastic lei. “Aloha!” our hosts announced to us, giving us each a gym flier to please join and consider all the fun you’d have.

The ship ebbed toward the distant manhattan satellite islands, the ones we were set out to discover superficially. On instinct a few people snapped photos and looked pretty. The quasi-Hawaiian theme only continued with the food; pineapple sandwiches, spam and fruit rice. The tiny paper umbrellas unfolded and the rum soaked brownies flowed. As we drank from whatever the pop-collared bartenders served. The buildings sipped the sky and then our plastic alcohol cups sipped their drinkers. There was a bit more to it but I wasn't paying too much attention. I only hoped Gala came.


The conversations were not. An overly tan woman with wispy blonde hair turned towards me. In sales maybe? She wore a flower dress, the only one prepared to feign for the occasion. She talked about her life, her recent trip to Puerto Rico, her fame as an athletics event organizer at a local gym years back. She cut our conversation short when a bulky French arm tattooed with a Mohican and a few snakes approached her. I moved away from her and the biceps unobserved.

Two girls from Tallahassee worked as assistant designers at a robot company. A developer from Texas shunned beef after growing up on a pig farm. The two event coordinators who met on a nude beach by accident. Besides shallow stories, I didn't find out any other details about anyone. Even the solicitors were seldom found, only checking in with people to make sure they were still on the boat. The ship's aimless bobbing to no destination was perfect for us. Our inebriated conversations mostly took all our attention from the cityscape view and ground it to dust.

After another tour of the deck, I finally found Gala huddled in a corner, her hair dyed an unusual dark rust that night. She waved me over and introduced me to Giulia. The frizzy hair, long white earrings, thick lipstick all shook with her rocky laughter. They clicked their full wine glasses, then waved them like flags. We had quick introductions before she cut me off.

"She's Italian." Gala raised an eyebrow at me.

"Stop it! You're not telling everyone I'm Italian. I am Italian though."

"She's studying to be an architect. She’s an inspiring architect." Gala giggled.

“I’m only an aspiring architect. See that building?” She pointed at an awkward thin building rising above the rest, a long white elevator shaft checkered with glass. “It's really tall but has those empty floors in the middle. It's earthquake proof right now. That's actually earthquakePROOF. Most aren’t. You have to think about that one."

"Who built it? Tell him." I tried to look at Gala but her eyes ran around mine, only meeting them for a fake  smile.

"A Russian architect, I don’t know. Don't ask me how I know. Or how I don’t!” Giulia laughed dipping into hysterics. Gala tried to join her but failed.

For a moment we stood like patriots minding the buildings as they finally drew us in. The tips of the skyline touching the clouds in the distance. Their cold sharp steel and glass reflecting orange and red shades. Empty rooms floating in the sky wasn't a completely alien concept. I knew they were all over the city. Sometimes even with people inside them. The ones that sat around topless with their cats ignoring the world through tv, as quiet and vacant as statues. Still... the rooms. Incredibly stupid.

Giulia whimpered, " Say are you Italian? You look it." She stared at me, then looked around aimlessly. It was impossible to tell how many drugs were involved in her demeanor. Perhaps none, even scarier. The sun was already setting down the darkness, making it difficult to see her expression. But I could feel her beaming violently.

"No," I yelled over the growing chatter around us. "Do you think I would fit in better if I were Italian?"

Gala’s head flitted up suddenly to look at me, like a bird, and then her gaze flew to the water.

"I don't know, I don't exactly fit it. Like I'm not married yet all my family is married I work at the campaign and lots of people just bail on you... During work too, people don't even notice. You know..." She paused, then turned to Gala, "I mean did you see Tony? I've been working past eight all week and he's said nothing. I don't really get how he even has his job. The other day, see... He's never filled out Jonas's call forms WE ALL did, can you believe that?"

"No, I can't." Gala shook her head without regard, looking into her drink. She looked offended as I pardoned myself to walk away.

The wind played with my hair as I sulked alone on the bow. We snailed in the water until we saw Lady Liberty. We sat a safe distance until we were in front of her. Everyone teetered to one side of the boat cheering, our gym solicitors blending in poorly with their purple shirts and exaggerated enthusiasm.

My disappointment lingered as I felt phone began vibrating in my pocket. The letters "Dad" crawled across it again the third time that day. I considered finally answering, but as it rang, I cycled through his questions. The ones I was tired of answering. The ones I didn't want to answer anymore. And as I recited the script to myself, the humming finally stopped.

I was always distracted. What did I think my pathetic prerogative was? I know now what I felt was fear. And I'm still afraid.

I sunk most of my time between the front and the bar. After a while, finally, the ship shrugged and swung in slow motion back to the docks. The riders were excited, lively, bored, full, happy, tipsy, celebrating, a bit seasick. Their final pictures were only shadows. The pier welcomed them comely, giving in to their now witless jokes and non-existent drunk charms.

Once docked, everyone escaped in a different direction for blocks on end. No one knew anyone anymore except those they came with. I walked home alone, my mind empty form disappointment. Past ten blocks and past garbage after building after loiterer. Its lids heavy, the city blinked half asleep as I went down the subway.

While on the platform, I turned around and noticed Gala smiling at me, her head crooked, teetering on her neck with a rish red blushed face. I what-the-fuckwhat the fuck jumped.

"You disappeared." She stumbled a bit then folded her arms, and lifted her hand up as if she was still holding a drink.

"Barely, did you like the boat?" I asked, coy.

"Yea well, you know it wasn't bad. It was good it was good."

"When I invited you I didn't know you were bringing a friend."

The trains murmured in the distance down the tracks. I tried to look beyond Gala but was distracted by the cute strands of hair in her face.

"Damn." She slurred, running her fingers through her hair "Damn! She was just a new friend. I wanted to impress her... What, did you think this was a date?"

She paused for my reaction, Her eyes wide open before elbowing me, "I'm playing with you, Om. I'm sorry. I think I had a bit too much. And sorry we didn’t hang out or sign up to work out together, sensitive guy. Thank you for inviting me. Really.”

She nudged me again and stared until I let go and grinned back at her.

“It was important she come and I’m sorry."

========================================================

"You hate me." She stomped, waving her hand in front of me. But I stood stern staring down the dirty tracks, afraid she'd fall off but I didn't move. 

“You going home now?” I asked the tunnel with a sigh.

“Yeah, to crash on my couch in Chinatown. Or maybe the bathtub.”

Trains flew by every track but ours, howling and screeching until finally a sympathetic one stopped. I got on, and she hobbled behind me, and even with plenty of seats she gravitated to the pole I held onto, to my disgust. A few glances at the crowd told me they were all rough. They must have been waiting for dryers because they were all wearing their laundry day clothes leaning on the windows. One snored in a corner.

I finally caved in on the silence and got a good look at Gala. She noticed, swaying to a standstill. Her cheeks were a deep rose red, Her eyelids sat heavy until suddenly they opened up, alive. I found a curious innocence in her eyes, the hazel brown mingling with a tinge of dark green. They were huge and beautiful. But now the only thing inside them was me, standing in front of her, waiting for her to wake up and tell me what I needed to know.

The train shook. With one sharp waver it violently pushed her into me. I held her balance catching last scent of her fading deodorant. For a few seconds her hands tightened around my stiff shoulders, muttering a tiny slurred appreciation. Then her warm body left me, taking a step back.

“What did you think of the boat people?” She smirked.

“Hmm I don’t know.” I started failing at anger. I'd lost it somewhere along in the tunnel, unsuspect to the creeping lethargy Gala's presence took over me.

“Anyone you know there?”

“No one. What did you think?”

She rubbed her chin into a butt over and over, “Well there were a lot of ‘in generals’, you know? A lot everywhere. Not many relatables. I’m usually only looking for the gems to talk to.”

"You’re one of those gems then?” I grinned her a flirt forgetting who I was, who Renee was. Then I touched her hand. Suddenly it became an accident. Immediately my face embarrassed, forcing my gaze at some ad for some an unknown college buried in a Manhattan backdoor.

The stops flew by until we hit the edge of Chinatown. She shift and whined “Sorry again.” Before she stepped out she took a closer look at my face. She inspected it, squinting, trying to find a clue. She then messed my hair and in a smug hobbled off the train.

"How about we go for a coffee or something?"

She stopped lopsided, turned around and took a deep breath. "You think that's a good idea? You think your girlfriend would be up for that?" She crossed her arms as leaned against a pillar but very slowly slipped down, a leaf brushing a cliff face. 

"I just figure you should sober up before going back to your friend’s place." My heart beat in my dry throat.

She hung her head in thought, but I had stepped out of the train already.

"Ok, yea that's a good. Coffee is great."

"Why not." I smiled.

"Why naut why naut..." she teased out my accent while I helped her up the steps.

At that point the Lower East Side had only barron streets to offer let alone a warm seat. But we finally found a diner with two coffees, each with a bit spilled into their saucers. Gala’s head rolled around as she sobered up, all over the table and against the booth. She started quick bored and forced laughs, then eventually real ones. As she did she took few ice chips from her complimentary water and rubbed them on her neck and forehead.

“I’m not in a good way.”

“You had mostly Mojitos right?”

“Mostly, maybe something else too, whatever Giulia gave me before. I just haven’t drank in a while. Mixing that stuff, that was... Not a great idea. I’m so sorry.” She wiped off her glass's condensation on a tissue then smashed it on her face, trying to wipe up the mess. I couldn’t believe her.

“What the hell Gala?”

“You probably think… Well I don’t know. I never did anything like this before. Trust me on that. I wanted to impress her or something. She’s got a job and I DON'T HAVE A JOB and she said she could hook me up with a job and she said she wanted to party and she said I could print some shirts too for her job and I thought then I didn't think.” after a deep sigh, she ironed herself with her hands. Then she pouted, her lower lip a fat cute shelf under her nose. I was amazed when every stupid thing reached deep into my throat and clutched my chest tighter.

“Dealing maybe?"

"No, she’s… Hm. She's helping campaign for the next mayor or some delegate. They’re having a protest in a few months. She’s inviting everyone to it if you want to come. The best kind of cockatiel is on fire.”

“Cocktail.” I said slowly.

She loudly sipped her coffee, then growled, "It's all about SURVIVAL. Are you surviving Om?" 

“I’m a survivor.”

“You’re a survivor.”

She then told me about her brother, about her life on Long Island and when she went to Italy and Austria. She flailed and writhed when the communications degree didn’t work out. But still she had to stay somewhere in New York City because it was the obvious option. She'd been on and off friends with it her whole life. Visiting it when it was sick, coming over when it had a party. How could she abandon it regardless of the torture she went through?

One hour later we were both much better but far more tired, the coffees having done nothing for us. We walked the small twisted streets, my arm around her shoulder down one alley or our hands almost touching down another. When we reached her stoop we rested in time before it became too awkward.

For a few moments we sat, and I watched her dig deep into her purse to pull out a thin cherry clove and light it. “You want one?”
“I think you’ve done enough damage for tonight.”

She laughing, poking me. I said I wasn't ticklish, but she reached anyway around my stomach trying. Her hand almost fully into my pants feeling as I felt fingers graze my pubic hair in shock. She continued searching for a twinge or a wince, but I offered her nothing. Her hand was warm and her body leaned on me while I smelled her faint coffee breath mix with the smoke. She gave up, taking her hand out to rub my head.

"No fun." she said puckering her lips then letting them fall, "Where's your girlfriend?"

"I don't have one." I said, half in a sleep coma. A crowbar rapped the pangs of guilt rapped against my stomach walls, and I felt them ringing. They were thick, heavy and hollow. Full of airy worry. They ached inside, but I tried to use the excitement to my advantage to fuel any intentions I thought I had.

"You're a liar." She poked me again.

"You're a cute liar. Where's your boyfriend?" 

She didn’t answer, moving to petting my neck, "You know what my favourite thing is?" She leaned in to my face, "I'll tell you.”

She leaned in so close she had my ear lobe between her lips. "Whispering.” she purred, “It makes me feel… So comfortable.” After we kissed a few times. In a haze she swore to call me later and that of course I couldn’t come up. And we’d meet soon and maybe she’d come see me at one of my shows or for a coffee and we could hang out maybe? I only looked back after she had gotten up and gone inside, closing the door.

At home, I wiped my face with a napkin to get any scent out. Renee barely did the laundry so she never knew and never found out. She was on the bed, topless eating tiny hard pretzels. She yelled at me how it was and why I was so late. I made up an excuse with Michael. 

The water from the shower that night felt . The water pressure used to be powerful enough to hose down an elephant until Renee demanded I talk to the landlord. Now it lazily sprayed water saving trickles down my face. I scratched my back, my scalp, my forehead, my face. I dug hopeful New York City hadn’t laid into me too hard before that night. But gray dirt caked thick under my fingernails. I let the water wash it all down and scratched again but there was still more. I dug harder until with the dead skin and dirt I hit blood. With the water making my back sting.
