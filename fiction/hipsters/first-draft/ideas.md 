-  Seems like you've been working on this a while

- Like the use of Mommy and Daddy, resonates her mind at that age

- I reddened, embarrassed that she’d seen my hunger to use these free things to compensate for things I’d lost.

 I didn't get that sense, that Lily saw it was compensating for lost things

Wondering if should show more of Lily's personality.

 It wasn't awkward so much as it was limiting.

It permeated the walls. The steps were steep and crooked. 


The walls of the office were painted off hue primary colors. Shy bold statements.

As we left I took a quick last look at Andy. He got up in fact, and in front of us all he looked me in the eye and said, "I forgive you" smiling, and shook my hand. His sockets sunk like battleships. I shook back blandly and headed towards the stairs, ignoring a snarl.

"You can come back and visit." Jack sleepily waved. The rest of the goodbyes procrastinated until we were out the door.

"Andy's changed! He's got a job and his life is getting stable. He's doing better," Renee was excited, almost blushing.

"Why do you care about someone who beat you?"

"He's just someone I still care about, he's a part of my life. You have to accept that. I've known him for so long."

And she tried to bring me back, "Hey! Come on! Don't worry of course I still love you. I'm with you now! Come on!" Renee laughed a whisper. I made a shut up smile. We walked back slowly in silence to the limo office, the only sound Renee's inner thighs rubbing against each other wearing down her jeans.

The receptionist was there. Behind the counter was a huge grin, a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She now hobbled busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone 3000km away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight. She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" She laughed hard. I picked through the letters. Renee took her phone bill and some sales flyers unabashed.

It had been a week, no notices. Apparently the government said nothing. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me. The cat hurled puddles of hiss and screams in our faces as we went in our apartment.

The sea of people ebbed and flowed to the train and I swam with them. I wondered about these strangers, and how strange they were. I wondered for a few moments where she went home, who he wanted to be, who are these people's parents, when were they born. Where do they think they're going and where are they actually going. Each person tried to sneak a silent look at the other. A cough gurgled up from somewhere buried in the crowd.

"Michael good morning!" Michael just came out of the building and placed himself in a nook. He towered over the street and passing walkers, over me.



"Isn't it too early to smoke?"



"Morning Kubrick. It's not too early. -You're - not too early," he smiled.



"Yea well I wasn't really looking forward to today." I said casually, trying to mimic him, "This project never ends Michael."



"You've got to bear with it. We could say we fixed a whole state's license system by the end of this. It's a long haul."



People rushed across the intersection, most in suits and black skirts. The sky cleared a bit and shed some light on the dank dirty sidewalk.



I sputtered out, "But, today's gonna be hectic and quiet. Like a goldfish dying. I don't really see an end to any of this."



"What are you talking about?"



"I don't know, nothing. It's a long story." 



"How long?" He coughed out.



"Well, Actually..." I paused. "it's a short or long story depending on how you tell it."



He chuckled a bit. His smile spelled out WHATEVER and waved me in.











I scrolled through a database of thousands of people, each with a name, birthday and an insincere smile waiting to be boxed again and printed.





I tried to build it so it could speak to me. The screen would scream something intelligible instead of staring back at me, instead of blandly holding up the garbage boxes and font I drew on it. I hope you understand.

The room swirled like a brick thrown through a window. There were voices, some scowling, some howling. Someone tried jowling their words in a effort to make them clearer. Someone whispered in my ear, "YEAAAAH!"



I thought a weight would be lifted. I thought we'd take it all in stride, catapulting ourselves to stardom. I thought we'd all be higher, together even, rimbaulding around... Our gullets wet and our minds thoroughly relaxed, waning in and out of pleasure commas. I thought the more I sunk the more I'd be in the thick of it. 



But really, I didn't and couldn't think of anything at that point. As soon as I had an idea it kicked me in the face. I felt it.



Was there anything to understand?

Even the priests and monks come down to beg, you fuckhead.

I wish this wall could hug me. But then it wouldnt be a wall.

She would complain sometimes of chest pain,

"Heart problems maybe." I smiled at her, "but let's be honest, who doesn't have problems with their heart.






The hues on a winter subway are all the variations of black you can imagine. The people transform into them but they're all really the same still. The bizarre silence mingled with coughs and low groans, the sniffles.



As we headed up I look down at the stairs to avoid watching the climbing asses dancing in front of me.



Gala was a careful watcher. The hand to my bag, my hand to the envelope, to her hand, to my face. She sounded out thank you in a voice so sincere it must have been practiced. She drifted off over the warehouses, floating above the east river, over the spiked concrete, her angel wings almost catching on a flag pole, back into the sky where she came from. My chest unfroze inhaling the winter back in, and I marched single filed back to my apartment a new slave.

I really hoped she would enjoy the eighty seven or so dollars in change from the unemployment office.

The novel is about the loneliness we create for ourselves and what we aspire to do in our lives. A man us stuck between a world he thinks he wants and responsibility.

We will make matsutake gohan to try them first. If the texture is good enough.

- Examining nature of Loneliness

- Everyone has a crutch

- Self is overrated

- Religion cannot rest independently from real life, real life is not independant from belief (basic axioms)

- Taking accountability is imporant. Choosing to be smarter then you are, ignorance, priveledge, or self loathing just digs a deeper hole for yourself.

- Cannot escape your past, need to face it to resolve it.

- All a balance, now currently not played or too curated an experience to be actually balaced.

- They blocked the light out completely until the exit.
