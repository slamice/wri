Ch10.

On Andy:

The cuts were only on the very top of arms. The blade was dull and it didn't really matter how deep they were, just that they were there. I saw them bleed marks into his pants though so he'd have to wipe them before showers or band aid them. Or maybe wear black pants. They weren't hard to hide but I'm sure he was lazy about them. As lazy as not to buy a shirt with at least short sleeves to cover them up.
