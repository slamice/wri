Ch5. 

My dream woke me up at five in the morning. But when I try to open them I find my eyes are sealed shut with gound ((crystally stuff)). I was kind of a mess and my clothes were not in great shape and I'm not sleeping again. So I need a shower.

The cat is deep in a coma between Renee and me. The balloon that is its stomach is a furry cartoon, inflating then deflating like a moron. I know it slept between us for a reason, but I'm a bad father. After I'm out it'll start breathing like a bad pulse with pauses and false starts.

The recycling plant hasn't started up yet, and even the limo office is quiet. Slipping down the stairs, out into the alleyway, it's a bland scene. The air is cold. The grey concrete colors match the browning buildings match the road almost too well ((inexplicably?)). One big dirty canvas I'm walking into.

I tried to remember Lebanon but my mind kept drifting to me hiking in the mountains. In the summer you can feel and see the sand cover everything. In the winter it rains in Beirut. And it rains. And after the prayers and everyone goes back to sleep the cobbled streets are dewey.

But the city loves you here. So it gives you all of its soot and dirt as you walk. You cough it in. I could feel even then it settling quietly on my face and arms. And when I scratch my face or back I stuff the silver garbage under my fingernails. I pick it out, because its nestling in there. It's always there. I scratch at my skin in the shower, on the train, on that morning. It's fucking stupid and its fucking disgusting.

Jack's light is off. With this darkness it was a rare occurence.

I curled up on a bus stop bench and stared into an overhanging traffic light watching teh lights change, going form red to green to yellow to red. I'm ashamed to say I didn't want to call. I wish I knew why I didn't want to call. Maybe its because I knew someone would have picked up. Someone was always home there, in and out. If it was Sabra or Ilias or whoever.
