Jack lives off the capitalist, can't survive without the art pimp.



Chapter 13

Renee moved out shortly after that. I helped her pack and hid the records we bought together that I wanted. Through the whole thing the cat took refuge under the bed like it did with every fight. But it must have mistook the situation, because teh choice was undeniable and after it was done, inevitable.

After two movers we contacted that day bailed on us, a desperate hail to Marley came through and she swung by to pick Renee's things up. Most everything was hers. There were boxes from her childhood back to pictures from when she was five years old. Pictures I chose not to look through. Half finished scrap books, sticker books, coloring books, everything a child could have wanted. They were all loaded in the back of Marley's car, and it took three trips to deliver them to her house.

The goodbyes were mutual, and we were too tired to fight. With the cat boxed up and the car running, we hugged out a goodbye and 

I worked my ass off from then on out. Daily then, maybe nightly. When I wasn't busy I at least tried to look it. I bought cufflinks for the first time. Everything I did became professional but honestly it never stuck out. The vast majority of my work was dead on arrival. I couldn't tell if that was the nature of the industry or me. A ton of ideas sprayed out from my fingers but faded lost forever into the drain of a screen that became blank all too easily.

A friday night Jack, drawly half drunk and inviting, had everyone he knew for his opening at the Bridget Donahue Gallery. It was a real gallery with real ambitions from unambitious people.

I thought I wouldn't notice the skyline after a million trips back and forth into Manhattan, but it grimly reminded me as the train rolled into the island over the bridge. I felt the buildings pierce into my gut, the higher the building the deeper it went in. Combined with the rest of the stress from work, I aimed for this to be a relaxing time but I was bullish on getting through it. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't read. I couldn't ((masturbate)) ((maybe too much?)) thinking of Gala or anyone. It was a horrific experience.

I got off at some station. A completely ambiguous one that tried not to point out all its faults. I walked from there, through the dead of wall street, past Manhattan's town hall. The cars slushing the slush in the streets and my shoes gently coddling the snow under my feet was my soundtrack as I lumbered over tenderly to the gallery that Jack was premiering.

When I opened the door rap music blarred. The beat stood dramatic and motionless every other moment, while the words came in a flood of how rich someone was and what car someone needed to approach them. The two attendance ladies took slight notice and offered to take my coat, and then a glass of plastic cupped wine. I rejected politely.

The crowd were as expected. No one was out of place, svelt coats too expensive for the bodies. I even saw a faux fur hat woman in the audience laughing hysterically to every man in the room. The men were sauntry, young, oh so intelligent with firm beliefs buried in themselves. I vaguely recognized almost everyone. The empire state twisted in my chest and my heart gave out hope. Who was I and why was this important.

I walked around nervously trying to distract myself. The peices stuck on the wall, irrevocably so. They were animated with objects jutting out of them, bumps and ridges and cardboard and social norms to destroy I guess. One had a knife stuck straight through it. ~Why was destruction so important.~ Why did the artist want his peice to die.

All of Jack's classics were up there. Everyone judged them meticulously and they liked what they saw. No one was disgusted and they sipped their wine from fancy plastic cups.

The realist of all of them was not Jack. He saundered around with a stick of straw in his mouth greeting everyone in slow delights. "Thank you for coming." He'd relay, shaking their hand in slow earnest. Some of the newbies stepped back, but others figured it was part of the show.


"I'm a bit surprised Prof isn't here."

"Prof. Prof is pissed. He left early this morning spitting out swears like a lunatic."

The pang in my gut worried me, but it seemed common place recently. "Why is he so pissed?"

"I don't know honestly. He didn't sleep at our place last night but came back at around seven in the morning kicking stuff over until I told him to stop. He was being an _asshole_ but I didn't uninvite him. Whatever he's got issues let him get over them."

"Renee was in here I'm guessing?"

"Yea she came for a bit, is it still awkward? You trying to avoid her?"

"Everything is awkward" I puttered.

Behind Jack was his corner I recognized some of Jack's staple pieces. And next to those was tiny black writing on little white plaques. Each of them were numbered "Untitled"s.

"He discovered me in .... Gave me my drugs, qualudes."

"I didn't know you were doing qualudes."

"Hey I'm not too picky."

I didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't know what they were.

The man in the corner, humbled with a blazer, spoke to a few beret'd critics ((cliches for the people trying not to be cliches)) waving his hands to the walls and farting a bit. Little Sarah was there, listening attentively, almost flanking his arm, teetering on the balls of her feet like a kid.

"His work reflects contemporary contemporaries. The inner space of this one... If Monroe Montague was here, actually in front of us, trying to communicate his theory of art in motion, he'd be obsolete. He'd be mute. He'd be doing a sign language dance. All you have to do is look at this masterpiece and it'll tell you everything you need to know about it. I wish he were ((was? Because of speech?)) still alive, I'd want Jack and him to meet eachother and duke it out. This is history. I swear it."

No one said anything for a few as they shouldn't have. Someone raised their glasses to that and a few clapped. Thye knew who he was, it was obvious. He marketed well, we was Jack's proud pimp.

The naked women still spewed out of a drain. They still spewed out of a drain. ((wasted art))


--------------------

I looked in all three rooms for Gala. Maybe she hadn't arrived yet, even though Jack said he invited her after I casually asked without wanting to push the question.

Then I saw Gala in a black shawl and dress, far more overdressed for the occassion than people can imagine. Prof was missing, a dying breed in action. She saw me and smiled, waving.


tepid (type of water?)

------------------------

I was having a hard time looking at the walls while I was distracted with all the talk. I forfeited my objective perspective with some nodding.

---------------

I wanted her to ask me if I wanted her. But she wouldn't say it. And I couldn't say it because the game would be up then along with the jig. It would be finished without a try.

So I pulled her close and she let me but gave me a disgusted look. "Gala let's go somewhere."

"I'm sorry Om." She shook here head unapologetically. She crept out of my arms looking straight at me waiting for the crumble, "it's not meant to be."

(("Can you be honest?" I said solemnly.

"I need to be with someone with direction. (not a hipster)"))

"Do you think that's what they'll offer you?"

Gala stared at me quite violently pouting to pity me. She was pitying another hard jumping off a cliff for her. "I hope you didn't misunderstand this. Will you be ok?"

"I'm fine. It was a joke, right? I did it as a joke."

"You're a good friend."

Our stares were let go into space. The monsters were loose and we walked away from eachother. It was impossible to know what she was thinking, and even she didn't know I'm sure. A bland taste started setting in my mouth, and I left the gallery forgetting my hat.
