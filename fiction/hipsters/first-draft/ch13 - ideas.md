I looked in all three rooms for Gala. Maybe she hadn't arrived yet, even though Jack said he invited her after I casually asked without wanting to push the question.

Then I saw Gala in a black shawl and dress, far more overdressed for the occassion than people can imagine. Prof was missing, a dying breed in action. She saw me and smiled, waving.


tepid (type of water?)

I was having a hard time looking at the walls while I was distracted with all the talk. I forfeited my objective perspective with some nodding.

I wanted her to ask me if I wanted her. But she wouldn't say it. And I couldn't say it because the game would be up then along with the jig. It would be finished without a try.

So I pulled her close and she let me but gave me a disgusted look. "Gala let's go somewhere."

"I'm sorry Om." She shook here head unapologetically. She crept out of my arms looking straight at me waiting for the crumble, "it's not meant to be."

(("Can you be honest?" I said solemnly.

"I need to be with someone with direction. (not a hipster)"))

"Do you think that's what they'll offer you?"

Gala stared at me quite violently pouting to pity me. She was pitying another hard jumping off a cliff for her. "I hope you didn't misunderstand this. Will you be ok?"

"I'm fine. It was a joke, right? I did it as a joke."

"You're a good friend."

Our stares were let go into space where the ether ((not real?))swallowed them up dutifully.

The lost monsters were loose and we walked away from eachother. It was impossible to know what she was thinking, and even she didn't know I'm sure. A bland taste started setting in my mouth, and I left the gallery forgetting my hat.
