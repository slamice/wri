That day I stared into Renee's eyes, and her into mine. I wasn't sure what I saw, or was supposed to see. They were like any others, and it wasn't like I could stare into eyes that long anyway. I guess it was a boon, really. When you can stare and no one is offended, or aggravated, or aggitated or uncomfortable. I imagine it used to be that everyone was allowed to stare into the other's eyes until they realized they loved them, meant something to them or weren't dead yet. I stared into Renee's eyes and I watched my fisheyed reflection watching back at me. One thing I didn't expect was to find myself in there, especially since people usually move too much to notice that.

We both knew the answer but were completely ignorant about it.((?))

It turned out Renee knew many people here for years. Marty was an ex-boyfriend and former singer of a sellout band now heading North to work in a hemp factory he's a nice guy you'd like him for sure. Another friend she fell out of touch with because of a cold war relationship in their English class in University.

"Evangeline!" Renee exclaimed.
