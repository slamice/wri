CHAPTER 3 establish rough relaionship with father

At work Haytham ((Om's dad)) called again.

"Yea?"

He coughed some static into the phone then replied quite loudly, "Hey son! Long time no talking! That's how you say Hello to your dad?"

"Hi Dad."

"How's the NEW YORK?"

"Better than the old one."

He faked a light laugh, which I appreciated. "Ah, as GOOD or BETTER?"

"Better." I replied.

"Ok, that's great. You enjoying it there computer scientist?"

"Enjoying it, is that the question? It's hard here."

I could hear my Dad breathe heavy into the phone, a bit out of breathe. Which was weird because he never exercised.

"Did you run or something Dad?"

"Yes son, I did run. I'm always running everywhere getting things for the family."

"Ah ok."

The long pauses were unbearable. I can think of a ton of things to say now. I know there would be no pauses.

"What about the visa situation. Can you come? Is it done?"

"It's not yet honestly. They are still processing it."

"You have to try to call them. They should give you an update."

I haven't recently, but I did try them a month prior and that was its eternal state, "PROCESSING". It was in their inbox. They could see the envelope full of my life. They could touch it, taste it, smell it. That's what they said over the phone. But the queue was long, they even had to cut a whole in the ceiling to fit the height of the stack. So they never opened it.

----------

"It's taking a long time. They told me they will give me an update when its finished. How's business?"

"Well we have to take care of a lot of things son, a lot of things. Your brother is helping a lot. He has school but he is helping still. Have you talked to him?"

"Not too recently."

"Please give him a call son." His voice became business like, sincere. "How about your Mom. Do you want to talk your Mom?"

"I kind of have to go though I'm busy right now."

"I see son. You are busy."

"I'll call her later seriously. You can't imagine what it's like here."

"Ok, well let us know son, we are waiting."

I nodded in the right places and waited. A few I love you's were exchanged, and we hung up. I don't remember who hung up first, but it was probably me.

Mom, heart problem.
