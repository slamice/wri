CHAPTER 3 establish rough relaionship with father

I had an old clamshell phone then, one of those flippers. The state of it was distasteful. The volume was also broken. Even when turned way down its deep bassy ring still begged to be heard against my leg.

The cow hummed in my pocket and it was dad. His number crawling over my phone so I hesitated a bit. The mistakable conversations we had with each were usually very brief. The surprise came when any of them lasted longer than 10 minutes. Like our conversations our relationship could have been taken lightly with few exclaimations, barely a few grams. I don't think I have to explain that any further. Between Haytham, Sabra and me, well, you'll understand if you didn't already. But I can be redundant, I guess.

I feigned ubiousness that it was him. I don't know why. "Yea?"

He coughed some static into the phone then replied quite loudly, "Hey son! Long time no talking! That's how you say hello to your dad?"

"Oh, hi Dad."

"How's the NEW YORK?"

"Better than the old one."

He faked a light laugh, which I appreciated. "Ah, as GOOD or BETTER?"

"Better." I replied.

"Ok, that's great. Better is very good. You enjoying it there computer scientist guy?"

"Enjoying it, is that the question? It's hard here."

I could hear my Dad breathe heavy into the phone, a bit out of breathe. Which was weird because he never exercised.

"Did you run or something Dad?"

"Yes son, I did run. I'm always running everywhere getting things for the family."

"Ah ok."

"So work is good? How is your position? Pay raise?"

We always had these topics; The Work, The Life and The Return.

I swear I didn't know anything about my aunts, uncles or cousins. Only that they were 'doing fine'. Any operations, epileptic seizures, sometimes even deaths were swept somewhere. Not under a run but in his pocket, ready to strategically come out at the right biting arguments. Well, barely arguments, because my nods were only accompanying his lectures like dutiful claps throughout them.

They were weak and dry and overbearing.

We came to a long pause. These were frequent and unbearable. It's not funny, but I can think of so many things to say now but nothing would change. I am positive he would hang up everytime.

"What about the visa situation. Is it done?"

"It's not yet honestly. They are still processing it."

I hadn't recently, but I did try them a month prior and that was its eternal state, "PROCESSING". It was in their inbox. They could see the envelope, one in a sea of lives at their post office. They could touch it, taste it, smell it. That's what they said over the phone. But the queue was long, they even had to cut a hole in the ceiling to fit the height of the stack. ((Hilarious.)) So they still hadn't opened it.

"You have to try to call them. They should give you an update."

"I did call them. I told you I called them. But they don't answer. And when they did answer they said they will contact me when they are through."

"You don't want to come home to visit?"

"It's taking a long time. They told me they will give me an update when its finished. How's business?"

"Well we have to take care of a lot of things son, a lot of things.

"How's business, Dad?

He sighed heavily through the phone. "Your brother is helping a lot. He has school but he is helping still. Have you talked to him?"

"Not too recently."

"Please give him a call son." His voice became business like, sincere. "How about your Mom. Do you want to talk your Mom?"

"I kind of have to go I'm busy right now."

"I see son. You are busy."

"I'll call her later seriously. You can't imagine what it's like here."

"Ok, well let us know son, we are waiting."

I nodded in the right places and waited.

"Call your mother son."

"I will."

A few I love you's were exchanged, and we hung up. I don't remember who hung up first, but it was probably me.
