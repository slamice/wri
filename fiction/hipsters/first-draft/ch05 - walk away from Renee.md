CHAPTER 5

A few nights later Selina virtually hit me up for a coffee. "Hello fellow human!" She cheerfully gleed at me through the phone. Selina didn't think "you guys" made any feministic sense, so she always opted for "Hello kindly people" or "Greetings fellow homosapiens."

"Hey."

"You should come out." she whispered, "I'm at Cup O'Joe."

"At the coffee shop?"

"A cough-ee-shop?" I could hear her red face.

"Are you high?"

"I may be high. It is a definite possibility."

"I'll venture there then," and hung up.

Once a month Renee invited some conspiritors over for a drum circle. A few natives combined with her friends and conspirators sat around a huge drum with their respective clubs. Incense was lit, hymnish things were sung. I was invited but kindly excused myself on those nights. It was interesting to find a clean apartment after coming back, at least the living room would be.

Renee had an eigthies Romcom on while she picked up clothes. I sacked on a pair of jeans, ignoring her critical looks. "I need to go out." I told her, "I'm meeting up with Selina."

"You can't just finish help me out with cleaning?"

"I think you have it handled."

"You never stay. You never stay home anymore with me." Renee puttered. "Or are you meeting another girl to stay home with?"

"It'll only be until you're done. There is no other girl."

"Do you like Selina?"

"Please not again. Please."

She paused the film for a second "Can you get me a latte then? French roast."

"Sure."

I still can't count the number of times I walked up and down those streets. I could point to where I found five dollars in change, where various throw up was spewed. Construction projects were laid out, miserably distorted around the blocks. I passed an oven was left to starve on the sidewalk, not before they stuffed it with empty bottles yet to be recycled.

((I remember that night distinctly because it was like any other night.)) The cold tried to creep into my jacket, into my pants. 

The down and out bars hid in the shadows behind car garages. Cool as they were, they served mac and cheese types of things, beer and little else. There were no windows so I couldn't see the people potentially dying from such a fire hazard inside. The two sushi places on the way I passed were idly populated. A bit further along, the projects were trying to project on to me, non discreet and brooding. The people who lived there almost all had projects. Brutal two day jobs, brutal childcare for their oh so many children and brutal laziness. Distanced, there were convenient stores far too expensive to be convenient. The arrangement was all a maze of zoning left over from a previous era.

A few girls sexed by me, some in tattered jeans, others in what looked like just shirts, shorts hidden in the midst. I was disgusted to think so, but hardly guilty. Also there was a native American homeless lady selling original symmetric artwork. She yelled twenty for each piece and I wondered if it was offensive that someone tried to talk her down to five.

At about that time I paced myself slower trying to time how late I'd be. I remember going in a haze, the buildings around me didn't exist as I stared at the ground or nothing. That's when I lifted a penny off the world and put the grimy thing in my pocket. This was money on the ground, pure value. Over the years I made quite a heap. Probably around sixty dollars. The change was all in a small jar. I never really felt I needed it though. It's the one thing I don't leave someone. Because no one wants the small, immediate minute pennies.

It was late but the dark cafe was still pretty active with many designers and artists slumped over tables and couches. Some yawned out conversations, others whooped mildly as they played risk in corners. Each table had a giant pinecone on it.

Selina's eyes were at half mast with a very visible hazy red in their corners "I got high with Jeremy tonight." She gleamed.

"How's that going?" I concerned as bitterly as my gingerbread coffee.

"I don't know, what do you think of him?"

"I don't know him."

"He's a good guy, you'd like him." Every other word from Selina was lightly hurkled with a distant tired smile. "He's a university radio station coordinator. His friend works at Happy Blue Cat so we got to watch so many old documentaries. Rare ones about doctors in the sixties and bikes."

"Like stunt bikes?"

"All kinds of bikes. Hmm." And then, "Are you alright?"

"I'm totally fine. Absolutely nothing happened."

"How's Renee? She never comes out."

"Yea she's doing her Drum circle tonight. The nativities."

Selina frowned at that. I pushed the envelope and the coffee mug against my cheek.

"What are you doing?"

"It keeps me warm. Warm cheekies. I don't even like coffee."

An eyebrow raised a chuckle, "then why order anything with coffee?"

"A latte is thicker so it'll keep me warmer."

The coffee was particularly strong, and since I very rarely drank coffee my head began to hurt. The milk was heavy and felt heavy going down, would be heavy on my way home and when I went to bed. And when I woke up the heaviness would be there to weigh down the rest of my day.

"Adrian's not working tonight looks like." I mentioned casually as I watched someone take a bit of avocado toast.

"She's playing tonight. At the Claybourne Whatever. It's the new place near Main and Clinton."

"Yea I heard about it. She plays a lot. You don't want to go? I'd totally be up for it."

She shrugged, "Kind of, but just wanted to take it easy tonight. Take it easy."

"Yea, me too", I said. "I started getting these weird spasms. My whole body would tense up for like a moment, then nothing."

((heart problems, kind of important part here, move to another section?))

"Oh my god is it a heart problem?! You never told me about this."

"I don't know but it sounds like a heart thing to me. I got checked up and they said they it's nothing they can find or detect, and that I shouldn't worry about it."

"You sure? Sounds serious."

"Yea, it's not a big deal they are rare and only last a second. But you can never be too sure."

Selina coughed and clutched her chest. Her fits were minor asthma leftover from her childhood. "So annyoing..."

"Heart problems maybe, not dangerous at all." I smiled at her, "let's be honest, who doesn't have problems with their heart? My mom is no exception." I said casually.

"Oh my god is your mom ok? I don't know anything about your mom."

"She's fine, they think it's something small ((would he say benign?)). Nothing to be worried about. ((why mention it then?))"

"You're dumping a lot of stuff on me tonight I don't know if I can mentally take it."

I looked around aimlessly. People worked away on their computers. Some were laughing, others sulking into their conversations.

"You see Gala at all?"

"No, why?"

"I don't know I started seeing her around more often. She comes here right?"

Selina started to look a bit frazzled. Upset wasn't quite the word, but her high was wearing off pretty quickly then.

"I don't understand why everyone wants to know about how Gala is. Is she so pretty? Or so interesting? She's cool but I get that five times a week. I don't even talk to her that often at The Meatloaf."

Both Gala and Selina worked at a soup kitchen together every otehr week. It's how they met. They called it The Meatloaf because it was the main thing they served for the homeless. More recently they put an egg in the middle of the meatloaf so it would look fancier and save on the price of meat.

(("You know Meat loaf gets really made when people think his name is one word."

"Who would call themselves Meatloaf anyway? Why would you do that to yourself?" She forgot about Gala at that moment.))

On my way out I ordered Renee's latte. ((Selina's haze started to brighten up, ))

I tried to change the subject, "I'm getting worried about my visa."

"Welcome to the world my friend." Selina raised her mug. "Where the proletariot never sleeps and we're drowning in our disappointment. It's us against it. We exist." she said dryly. "It's been a while though?"

"It's just so beauracratic. It's been a year and will probably take longer." I said, shrugging.

"Why don't you marry Renee?"

"I don't think we're quite there yet."

"So it's a commitment thing? Like responsibility stuff?"

I looked at Selina, "I think mentally we're not there yet. We both have our reservations."






The detour I took on my way back was long. I went through a village of modern apartments complexes, still deserted. Apartments that were half finished had already been bought. The concreate jutted to the sky. I wondered for a moment what it was like to live on the top floor, to live on any floor. Soon there'll be rich toddlers. There'll be yoga pants. There'll be dogs running around everywhere here too. Dogs. My coworkers would love these places. Basterdized Bauhaus. The same sky's they'd be under has been around longer than birds, but to the new residents it'll be a nice touch and a simple distraction from what they needed to do to need to do.

Before I moved I heard the city did something to you. The city that was the interest. But I'd walked miles around it, in it, through it and I found nothing. I found concrete with garages or delis on every other corner. 

But what makes a city? People. What were the people doing on the sixty seventh floor, what happened in the basement on the third Wednesday night of every month. What opened, what closed, who was creating something beautiful. But I'm not sure I found any people with anything. It was many nights where I walked the streets with people holding up their umbrellas, all of them going in trickles on small streets or busting out of subways on the main ones spewing into the street. I watched the rain water go down the drain. Sometimes it overflowed but it all went down the drain. The point was lost.


I thought about it a lot. There is no counterpart to 'lonely'. It's implied that a person is naturally with other people. And in loneliness, there is a problem. Because no one is naturally lonely. 

I realized when people get out of the city, like when I was hiking Qurnat as Sawda, the comfort is not that you are alone. Because the nature is there, you feel you aren't alone. You are small but you are not alone. There is always a comfort deep down that you are part of it, and they get out to remember that, whether they realize it or not. And there are no drains.

I leaned against a giant metallic bird statue only a larger metallic mother bird statue could love. I sipped Renee's latte, the ice melting inside it as my hand warmed it. I looked up and tried to find a star while under the street lamps. But they glared far too much.

A couple walked by me holding hands like people who still held hands. They were deftly upsetting and rearranged my stomach accordingly.



















I hummed a soft sylable in a bass, my eyes still closed, forgetting the world. I could still hear the wind so I tried to shut it out. And the street cars. And the silence. I thought about what I was looking for.

But the latte was cold now and getting colder and wondered where it was, so I had to save it.

Honestly you were just there, and I loved you. But really, we grew apart just like I grew apart. You were cautious and protective and it horrified me for a long time. 

On my way back I passed by Jack and Andy's apartment and noticed the light was on. A fever of rage suddenly overtook me on my walk back. Who was Andrew. Such a bastard. I wanted to tear off his limbs and beat him with them.

WHen I entered the apartment Renee and her friends Ethan and Marley were talking to an elder native named Farmer's Son. I simply gave a nod to their direction as I headed into the kitchen. They waved and nodded back but Farmer's Son had them pegged at something in their conversation. In the kitchen I overheard them talking.

"I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do." Farmer's Son said.

"How many more times at the sweat lodge would it take?" Ethan asked, I could barely hear him.

"It's not a simple thing to take. I'm sure you can find a way without me."

Renee chimed in, "but we've been practicing for years here. I've been twice already."

Farmer's Son "Let me be honest with you." he said, his low voice sounding tired, "This is very deep. You don't need me to introduce you to anyone in Peru ((for ayahuesca)). You can go as tourists. Again thank you or holding this."

I barely heard the echo of him going down the stairs while Renee discussed something with Ethan and Marley as they left.

"He called us tourists." Ethan told Renee blankly.

"We are not tourists." Marley told her blankly.

She waved them off and sounded out a goodbye to me. Renee went to lie on her bed from there, disappointed and ignoring me turning on a movie.

"Can you turn on the laundry again? I forgot to take out the clothes so they might have mold on them." She called out.

"Yea, sure."

I immediately went outside and shut teh door carefully, making sure the cat didn't escape. Just around the corner, under our bedroom window, I dumped Renee's forgotten latte in slow motion. The stream made a quick splash and settled in the cracks of concrete. It was ((fully)) empty, I lurched back upstairs.
