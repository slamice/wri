CHAPTER IX. Anne of Green Gables and will the Horrors Never Cease

The answer is a polished no. Anne was now a fortnight in. Mr. and Mrs. Marilla Pleb couldn't contain her so they let her run free like a beast in between meals. Anne got to work studying her surroundings. She's lay out a battle on Prince Edward Island sooner or later, and where to dig trenches was a key decider in a battle. Everywhere was a lush lush green that was too hot to handle. Canada was a vegetation nation and Anne would surely be its gardener she thought, running her hands through thick reeds. She rode to and fro on passing elk, tasted streams fresh with fresh salmon flying out of it, some hitting her in the face as she laughed playfully, taking a bite out of a few.

Among the peons Anne was a furly furror of rumor and they simply have not stopped talking about her. Of course they all suspected she was soon to be a new queen, no one yet believed they'd be trampled by a red headed freckle baring baroness.

Among those plebbing was Mrs. Lindt. As described previously she fancied herself some type of oracle or orb that needed to be fed, in this case knowledge about orphans. She was confined to bed due to bedsores and grippes. Bed sores a terrible chicken in the egg dilemma that was rare among farmfolk at the time. I mean what would you do, you have sores stay in bed. The Grippes particularly were never ending though, she was always about those. Eventually she got better, and immediately wanted to start some drama off a few gabley greens. She went off in a hoo to hoot some hollars at our little Royal Anne the orphanette.

Mrs. Lindt appeared on the horizon, slowly approaching the Greenhouse in a casual stride, arms out swinging.

Even at that distance she bellowed, "Top of the morning!" She was no spring chicken but she fancied herself one. Finally making it to the door, she spilled her gullet with her grippes of sores earfuls full. t came out like a slide down to Marilla Pleb's lobes and she just sat listening to every gripe, gripe by gripe.

But then immediately inquired the LIndt inquired, "Let's get down to business..."  and broke her voice in, her chocolatey vocals exclaimed loudly _in a hither_ "Where is the child?!!?!" she demanded.

"She's in the orchard or something..." Marilla Pleb exclaimed quietly. Her face red like a tomato, due to genetics and the homemade gut rot brewed a few nights before.

"You've got a fine new one. I thought you wanted some valiant sons all up in here, some bread winners not makers."

"We'll see who wins the bread around here." Mrs. Pleb miffed. "You should check out our dearest Anne. She's thick in it now."

Mrs. Lindt squenched her eyes narrowly at Mrs. Pleb. "You never had kids, You have no idea what you're in for." Oh no Mrs. Lindt, you have no idea.

"I'm not feeling discouraged" She said dryly, so dry in fact she spit up a bit of sand. "I'll call her in."

No calling was need be heeded. Just at that moment Anne walked in, somehow skipping with delight and mapping out a few charts in hand. She was still wearing the dress from the asylum, ragged and tattered that she made the most of. he hair was full of leaves and twigs while she was practicing trudging through the marshes and pits of an unseen battle ground. She looked up from her notes and the two commoners looked back in silence.

Mrs. Lindt's mouth was open, a yawning chasm you could stick a tree trunk in. She saw Anne's guard down and wanted to take her turn to poke the soon to be queen, just like the first time you see a frog and you want to poke it with a stick when you're 3 years old.

"She's terrible skinny and homely. Come here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart, bear sway, did anyone ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! And red onions! Come here, child, I say."

Anne now stared at the Lindt and walked towards her, her gaze stuck on her. She took one huge lunge towards her and bellowed out a laugh fit to kill.

Now take out all your cliff notes and smoke them, because they are useless and the truth is here and now. Anne was a monster with words, and she was ready to easily demonstrate that on a brand new kill. She didn't know how to recognize the chocolatey peon, but she was ready. Her wits as her sword, and slice this shrew, this cucumber, in two.

"Your face..." Anne whispered, and then thundered "Gives me the pip! You are the witching hour, peasant. Vegetable insults, how typical."

"Anne!" exclaimed Mrs. Marilla Pleb in disbelief constipation. They could only look only as Anne sweared up and down the Prince Edward island coast, spitting out insufferable maledictions. Her temper now long gone, jumping olympic hurdles kilometers away.

Anne begins pounding her fists on the ground at this point. She's stamping her feet like she's in a musical, ore stamps than a postoffice can sell a collector. Stampy stamp stampy.

"You are worse than a drunk on skates. People have died for less than that. You have no imagination, you're a quack, you're ugly, you have not even a spank of imagination. And so the f ON _to hither_! When I am queen." she said shrilly, her freckles on fire, "I'll never pardon you, you can be sure of that."

"My word!" Lindt was slowly melting into a pudding of scared, a cowardly custard.

"NOT YOUR word MY word!" Anne screamed a tornado.

Mrs. Lindt was thoroughly horrified, her rosey chocolate cheeks now ceramic white. Things were getting horrior and horrier, so Mrs. Pleb ushered Anne to her room.

No one has ever disrespected her as much in the asylum, she thinks. Tears begins flowing and Anne just pulls it together, she just pulls it together, and goes off up the stairs. Both her hands in bloody fists, a mess of papers scattered around the room, the floorboards destroyed. A subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.

The house was quiet for a few. "Well, I don't envy you your job bringing THAT up, Marilla," said Mrs. Rachel Lindt with unspeakable solemnity.

"You shouldn't have done a twit at her looks"

"You're holding back a tyrant Mrs. Marilla Cutthroat Pleb. This is unheard of. Countries have banished less on principle."

"We need to raise her right." Mrs. Pleb said with a thorough glance at her. "I'm not saying she's not stark raving mad, but there is no dignity in degradation."

"What's bred in the bone is bred alone!" she fought back, but Mrs. Pleb didn't understand because it didn't make sense.

"I'm too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind. You'll have your own troubles with that child. But if you'll take my advice—which I suppose you won't do, although I've brought up ten children and buried two—you'll do that 'talking to' you mention with a fair-sized birch switch. I should think THAT would be the most effective language for that kind of a child. Her temper matches her hair I guess. Well, good evening, Marilla. I hope you'll come down to see me often as usual. But you can't expect me to visit here again in a hurry, if I'm liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It's something new in MY experience." And with that she got about, obviously shaken from the experience, and trotted off back home.

Mrs. Pleb waddled up the stairs like a tomato with two eraser head legs. She thought again and again. How should she punish Anne? She would be insane to resort to whipping. That would just multiply the personalities Anne is already harboring further into the light, little did she know. She couldn't take it all anyway, so she patoned into the room clutching a few rosaries and drilling them madly in preparation to what she saw.

Anne was exhausted and crying into a pillow. Even for a young queen she couldn't take this ridicule, and decided to sob her sorrows to it, unabashed.

"Anne," Mrs. Pleb said not ungently.

Crickets. Tumbleweed. "Wow, cause when you're the Queen everyone wants to take a turn or two to fuck with you", Anne thought.

"Listen to what I have to say to you," Mrs. Pleb sterned up. She had to teach Anne their ways. "It was completely unnecessary, under our roof you should uphold yourself better."

"She hadn't any right to call me ugly and redheaded," Anne retorted, tossing back her hair with a waggle of her eyebrow.

"You have disgraced us, Anne. It was practically a curse you put on us down there."

"How would you like it though," Anne retorted again, "If you were called ugly, red faced, fat, skinny, jowled, disfigured, a drove of hogs, a jally pally, a stiff drink fraught with perils."

Mrs. Pleb looked on at her and she watched a leaf from her hair fall to the floor. An old remembrance suddenly rose up and visited her at her brain's door. She had been a very small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, "What a pity she is such a dark, homely little thing." Marilla was every day of fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory. But she remembered it again and that was a fail. The memory laughed and left with a commercial jingle.

"She's still my visitor and old. You have to be nice to these people Anne."

"Tie me to the dungeon chain then. Use whatever medieval instruments you have lying about in this green hell." Anne said defiantly as if she were ready to die for her country. She knew all too well unfortunately they had no dungeons she could demonstrate her bravery on, but mustered that mustard up one none the least.

Mrs. Pleb insisted a firm apology, threatening all sorts of timeouts, delayed desserts and absent lunchmoney. But Anne only quivered in disgust. "I will never apologize and will have to stay here forever then.

"I'm sorry I've vexed you; but I'm GLAD I told her just what I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can't say I'm sorry when I'm not, can I? I can't even IMAGINE I'm sorry." Mrs. Pleb dismissed herself after that without a word.

As Mrs. Pleb left Anne smiled and a bit of drool slipped out. Thinking thoughts about her future thoughts, Queen of Canada, she knew that heads must inevitably roll, and pictured Mrs. Lindt in a mess of chocolate, dripping with death.

Heads will roll indeed.
