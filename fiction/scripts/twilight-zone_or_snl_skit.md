Man is interviewed by a recording but thinks it's a real person remote



Sales guy goes in a room to be interviewed
Is interviewed for 20-30 minutes from a tv screen, because person on screen is remote
Screen person tells sales candidate to change cd, get a new cd to insert
Sales candidate doesn't understand
Sales candidate discovers the remote guy isn't remote, but that he was interviewed by a recording






Interviewer guy lines:

"Put in the second cd."

"Ok, you're hired."

Part of the joke is the interveiwer keeps talking to him even though he's a recording, predicting almost every reaction.
