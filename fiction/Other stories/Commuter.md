A Commuter

Noisily burrowing in the Bronx, the train shook like a heavyset man as it threw itself into high gear late into the night.

Samir sank into his orange plastic seat. Other commuters drooped like him. The air was so thick with droops you heard them dripping off the seats, puddling to the floor. Some of the commuters' faces, pockmarked, stared blankly at nothing in particular. Others were lost in their headphones. A few bodies molded themselves around train poles, others' asses seeped into nearby creases.

Much before then he had fled alone with a million people on a boat, but could never quite grasp the country he landed on. He thought much about the America people told him about, most who've never been there. Were his expectations met? After escaping from the war, he laid on America numb and indifferent. An electrician with poor English and circumstances made him useless to the trade. It was just as well; he was too tired to move.

Samir's body exhausted. Today and everyday he labored around the city disguised as a normal person within Midtown. He travelled hundreds of blocks for a reason; he was lucky enough to get work and knew it. His days were spent hidden behind salad bars, breaking sweats through lunch rushes. Later, he panted over pants in a laundromat. Particularly hairy, every day the sweat clung to his back until dark and finally let go. One long wet pet.

Everyday he rode but recognized no one. And no one recognized him back.

The conductor coughed in, and Samir assumed he was bored because he pronounced the train stops delicately with a joking coo. Every station name and _next stops_ were getting a few chucklettes from passengers. "Nereid Avenue" was announced next with a quiet whine.

Steel doors slid open, and a few people dragged themselves off while Samir sat there. His body, and he, were undeterred. He didn't want to pass the corner stores. He didn't want to drag his feet seven more blocks to his walk up apartment. At least not yet.

Samir sat there wondering when he'd get up. If he had to cut up any more lettuce, fetch any more white tube socks with gray heels, then he could at least stay one more moment.

The announcer sang the last stop's "Wakefield-241 street" and the doors yawned open. People piled out but a few shifties only shifted, staying on, looking indifferent. An unusually happening Spanish family, fashionable and popular among their peers, chatted each other to their seats. An older lady with a huge straw hat simply shuffled like cards to a corner.

Samir's eyes swung past beam after beam in the dark corridor the train drifted in. He stayed dreamily in his seat, waiting for the train's turn to back track.

The tunnel soon flooded with bright florescent light. Hundreds of white tiles fevered on the walls until they covered them and Samir's body twinged in puzzlement. His mind hadn't caught up with his environment yet, but it gradually grew curious and surprised. His stop somehow vanished.

Soon the tunnel opened and the conductor, in a heavy and muffled voice announced "South Kensington". Breaking open again, the doors welcomed an older gentleman out. A moment later a small crowd high heeled and loafered into the car, looking as high as risen loaves. They laughed in between half drunk coughs. One had an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip. They spoke as if their mouths were full of bread and they were choking it down, guffawing hard. In the corner, the straw hatted lady looked on at them unimpressed. Then away.

Samir's eyebrow twitched and he felt himself waking up. Out a window he witnessed speckled yellow tiles spread across the floor living in the brightly lit tunnel. Too clean for the Bronx. He gulped holding himself, wondering who to ask or gesture, but Samir's English was weak enough to break so he hardly used it. The missing words sat sad and crying nestled behind his tongue.

Samir knew he was on the same train many moments ago, and yet he had no idea where he was. The people were clues standing around him, just back from discos and pubs spitting and shouting odd remarks in thick pasty white accents. But these details were lost on him, they were for someone else.

He thought the situation might correct itself in a few and held out, a few steps back from the drunks. He almost got up to approach the group in front of him, but his nerves rooted him to his seat.

The oval brightness morphed into a dark round gray. It passed quicker and quicker, only the pipes remained in constant view. While the train slowly began hoarding rowdy racketeers on every stop, Samir pondered the people who still rode with him. The quiet straw hatted lady in the corner stared beyond nothing. The Spanish family continued to chat in brief spurts to each other. Samir studied their faces. They were completely without a doubt. No one was surprised in the least the world had changed and kept changing.

The announcer was barely audible above the static suddenly crashing into the car. Now equipped with a full on an English accent, he barked "The next station is Marble Arch".

A few talkative bunches got off the train, bumbling in stupors. An older balding man stepped on and sat opposite Samir. And they continued.

Samir questioned his sanity. Maybe they were going back, back to the end of the world, back to having nothing necessary. He prayed while the sounds of the train nestled into his heart and punched it from the inside, beating on it harder and harder. And he sat there in silence, wishing his English and biology would improve instantaneously.

For hours they travelled down the only direction the train knew in a hurry, practically leaping across the runway. The conductor's voice grew harder and harder to understand, not from teh static but from teh bronounciations. Samir began to give up when it announced "Cowcaddens" and "Ibrox".

A rhythm formed whenever the doors flew open and closed, while the newly arriving singles and families grew paler and then darker then paler again. What was animated just before smiling faces, laughs, banal chats and even kisses were replaced seconds later when the train massaged all from existence. Everyone fell under the spell. The Spanish family remained seated and the lady remained in the corner, reading a newspaper that materialized out of her bag a moment ago.

Eventually the tunnel lights grew lighter again. Samir slumped in his seat as they flushed deeper into the tunnel. Once they emerged, the walls were cleaner than any station he'd seen in New York or anywhere. The receiver twinkled out a few bright sounds, a clear low solemn voice pronounced "Valcarca" in an accent. The Spanish family got out excitedly while a few small crowds parked themselves orderly on seats and in corners.

A small jetblack haired kid sat next to Samir with his mother facing him. The kid held out a flat aluminum papered stick between his fingers. "¿Chicle?" he offered. His mom glanced at both of them and smiled.

"No, thank you is ok." Samir smiled back, but he realized "Excuse me, excuse me. Where is here?"

"¿Qué?" she asked him.

"Where is here?" hoping dreadfully she'd understand. His skin started flaking from the stress and the air conditioner.

"¿Qué? Eh, Barcelona. Barcelona." She said in a half smile.

"English? You say English?" hopefully.

"Ah, siento. No Inglés" Her face puckered a sad smile. Her son looked out the window and Samir nodded out two thank yous.

As the people moved on and into each other, so did Samir's sighs. People from all corners of the earth bobbled, hopped, dashed, dragged themselves into his car. Each station was dirtier than the others, then cleaner. The cars were packed with silent bodies or bizarre ones. Eventually Samir grew bored of sitting and standing. He began to feel stale and bland on top of the panic. He got up, navigating each crowded compartment. 

He frowned at the stupid windows that were too stuck to open but only saw his life speeding by, the blur behind the dirty glass. The other passengers were in the glass too. It's not that they weren't hospitable. They weren't but, anyway they had to be somewhere in the world.

Despite the warning signs to avoid walking between cars, there for aesthetic and dramatic effect, he opened the door and didn't hear the hollow thunder echo in the subway tunnel above his own confusion. Stepping into a new car steadily ignoring a few stares, he muttered "Excuse" after bumping into an older lady, but she was tarnished.

"Do'n leen on me." came the bark, followed with an aggressive hiss.

The possibility of a conversation had just leapt off a cliff, so Samir further muddled through this car.

"New York?" He braved and the car hushed. The air opened its many eyes watching him, he knew they were on him, but most bore blank stares with barely any acknowledgement.

"New York City? Where?"

A few people laughed, but most dismissed him. He tried this in every car anyway. One passenger shook their head, another glared angrily, one smiled and shrugged.

After quietly making it through the entire train, taking him twenty or so minutes, he had reached the conductor's car.

He knocked on the door once, harder again, pulled at the handle, but with no results. The dark glass on the door looked back at him, pitying but stern. Samir took a deep breath and it did too. Save a handful of people's eyebrows, nothing gave Samir much notice. Lonely, he felt like a spirit without the haunting. A failed ghost.

He sighed in frustration, but a second wind hit him. Bravery pulled his hand up to the emergency break against the wall. He looked around but no one made eye contact with him. The wooden red handle sat there on its dirty and frayed cord, shivering as the car rattled. Samir braced himself as he put his hand around it, looked back at the distracted faces, and then gave a sharp tug.

The emergency brake must have been broken, or never worked, because it did nothing. He tugged hard, putting his weight on it, but it felt like a toy. Again and again.

Samir somehow knew he couldn't stop. He wiped his hand on his pants for fear of train cooties and cursed.

***

It must have been a good five hours. He had hopped through each car, memorized their numbers but the situation remained the same everywhere. He got sick of the doors opening and closing. He tried talking to anyone, but most spoke little English, if any. He was tired of ducking by children, squeezing by businessmen. But mostly he was tired of sighing. Samir went back to his original car. And while heavily distracted with disappointment and confusion, sleep overtook him.

Again slumped in a chair, he began to drift off to the rhythm of the car shaking as it ran on the tracks. In another hour it quieted. The crowds began thinning out.

When his stomach felt hunger pangs and his eyes opened he saw only a single person stayed with him, the straw hatted lady lady. Samir walked toward her hopefully, wondering with a heavy heart if she knew where they would ultimately end up, if anywhere. She noticed him lazily, pursed her lips and  dropped them. Then again her lips judged him.

"Excuse?" Samir intended it shyly but it came out perverse. "Where is here?"

"We on the train honey." She said bluntly. A blank stare on Samir's face made her yell "ON. THE. TRAIN."

"Yes, ok. On train... Where?"

"You asking me? Why you asking me?"

"Where do we go?"

"It's ok, we goan hawm." She quickly lost interest, her eyelids grew heavier and glanced back at her paper.

"It is not ok." Samir began to get angry at her coldness, and he couldn't tell if New York hardened him or her or the train. She suddenly looked straight at him.

"Wha you mean?"

"Why ok? We go far. It is not ok. Where you go?"

"No one forcing you ta stay here. You can ge' off anytahm."

The conductor exhaled something incoherent as they slowed to a stop. The lady got up pushing past Samir without another word. A rush of cold air gushed in Samir's face. Between huge white pillars a sign read "Алекса́ндровский сад". He saw her hobble off as the doors slid closed, bobbling bravely away on the bright cold concrete. Her darkness contrasted the sea of white, looking more lonesome on the platform as the train sped away. A single period on a clear page.

He sat for another hour while the train stopped at places which meant nothing to him. Each time a door opened a new bland painting revealed itself. Frustrated, he ran his hand through his hair weighing his choices. The train will never go back. Never.

The next stop was deserted, and the intercom didn't crackle on this time. Samir sensed the train was as tired as himself. Its engine whined until it sighed an exhaust. The sign outside read "도곡　Dogok　谷道".

He stuck his head out looking down the striped platform. It felt eerily clean and silent. He didn't know when he'd see the grayish black hues of concrete and brick he was used to again, but at that point he didn't much care.

The doors stood open, mocking him for several minutes.

Without another thought he took a step, and walked out. His shoes echoed squeaks in the tunnel until he vanished upstairs.

A few minutes later a ringing packaged the train up, and in moments it was gone.
