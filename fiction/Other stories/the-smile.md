---------------------

New York Cit turned itself over daily, well unrested. It never sleeps but is always tired. And on the train everyone wants a seat, most need it honestly, after the day everyday.

((The)) people's imaginations paint the city with a dark, broody expressionist palate. It's as glossy as a picture. The street and buildings bleed into eachother fluidly, they acknowledge all the history and culture you could possibly want, and theyre always playing together for you. Just for you.

But really the concrete stands still when you pan left or right. What you imagine to be paint is rust, mist is ((cigarette)) smoke. The magic is all in the people, but with a rough trade of glances you know they are mostly amateurs, and how much you'd believe them.

I was headed home. My body was empty after digging out my energy into the day, left with only the boredom. The train arrived slowly to the platform, and so many people hobbled on and crushed my sides, but only to the extent of discomfort.

I searched for a seat but they were all occupied with various dgrees of tired and apathetic.

Until one. I stood in front of a small woman, anywhere between eigtheen to twenty eight. Her pure black cap was firmly on with her long brunette hair flowing out the sides. Her jeans were ripped at the knees. Her shoes were not fit for winter. Their season puzzled, because the shoes looked as if they were shrugged on without worry.

You can't imagine the chill then, when she looked up at me the frst time. I shied away from practically everything, confrontation was my worst enemy in many ways. But the way she looked, her eyes chestnut brown.

It was also partly the fact that she looked. No one notices the other, especially underground, unless they are dead and need to move the body.

-- But a look on is common. A typical subway look takes two seconds at most and is far from hostile.

Her posture was very calm, and between twiddling her pone she twidled me.
 But she borrowed a few more and opened a whole into my shy soul and smiled at it, like looking at the perfect pebble at three years old. Her mouth and eyes beamed at me, reaching deep into my throat and tightening my chest.

I forgot about the old sullen doubting Russian ladies eager to look for frustrations. Or the meek, the bizzare, the dangerous, as many cliche's as can be counted. They were part of the scenery, but the car framed her while she looked at her phone, then at me in the window reflection, then a smile straight at me again as she looked up. Even a very tiny chuckle.

The next thirty minutes were not relaxed and played out very slowly. The glances were less than subtle.

My dream began where I asked her her name, where she could meet me again, did she like her socks on or off when it came to that.

Maybe she thought I was in high school and I knew Mr. Tweedman, right? Or she was drawn to my rich mess of a stuble.











At her stop, she got up, and left. I stayed on, and wondered if she would look back. And she did, and smiling one last time before digging for treasure alone deep in the city, almost whispering a goodbye.
