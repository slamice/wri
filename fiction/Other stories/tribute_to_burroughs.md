(After reading "The Ticket that Exploded")

The jar lay tattered in muck, soot and rotting embers -- but was still clearly full -- thousands of tiny lives moved inside quivering like blood leeches -- an orgasm of light and movement screamed into the void shooting a thick erection of sound.

The man's penis was half erect in curiosity, moved his hand cursor closer to the forbidden sex mouth. The teeming team trembled and frolicked, touching kerfuffling each other's junk tiny pockets with acrobatic accuracy. The legged larvae postulated at the mouth waiting in earnest for it to explode in a twisted foghorn leghorn sex move. They waited eagerly to shoot like the spunk of jissum onto the waiting drenched floor.

The buttchapless man smacked his lips as the crawlers squeezed waiting for their madness to embolden them. One twist set them on fire as they stomped sex words on their faces, noses, nostrils, genitals and tongues.sex words danced on sex words cultivating orgasm farms nestled between thunderous sex thighs. The junkie's junk's junk jumped at the height of their movement. It was a credible show they put on, a masterade.

Ribbed hard white encased lice shelled in strong smooth exoskins fished into eachother's sharp mouths kissing and touching fucking their eyes with eyes all smells of the rectum rainbow gushing gases of anticipatory pleasure they could feel in their human skin mouth flaps.

It unscrewed further like a plug deanaled. Waterfalls of penis envy excitement washed over them as they spit horrendously never missing their targets.
