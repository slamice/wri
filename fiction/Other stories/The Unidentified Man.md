A stay of five hours. I'd been to Grand Central a few times now. Very central. To. Places.

This time around, I grew out my beard into obscurity. I was visiting an old friend, and back in old country we had beards. We grew them out when we were in our late teens, super confident we were the kings of worlds, champions. It made us feel older and wiser, beyond our years, beyond any negative sentiment. We were fully powered to take on the day. But 40 years later we learned they did nothing, but as a joke we wore them again.

He owned a few getaways upstate now. They were small but he made some money off of them, property always makes money, he told me, especially with New Yorkers. New Yorkers love the scenery, the quiet, they love it in a hurry. Two nights could go for three hundred each, all you have to tell them is they can finally see the stars. Winters were awful though, but you just start advertising for ice fishing.

So we promised to meet again one day, way back, before I left old country. It seemed liek forever, and I did forget teh promise, a few times. But now I was ready. I had a business and I some of it took me to New York, so a few days off was minor, nothing comapred to meeting up with my good friend.

I decided against a car, because he was roughing it too. So I found the train to be cheaper, far cheaper than a rental and some gas. Far cheaper than a flight. And I would live with the rest of them. It was a time for golden memories. It was a time for old country. Just this once there is a chance for old country, it should live up to my joke as much as my beard did.

I arrived early, at the Grand Central. Many people were walking underneath the artificial roof. The sky was immense, expanding across the room. Such a big dome. I rushed to the train schedule, only to find that my train was to leave at two hours in future. So I was very pissed I swear. What was I going to do for two hours?

I didn't feel like walking. I can't walk too far anyway, I have a condition my doctor told me, so I didn't want to strain it. What was over in the far anyway? Probably nothing important. People. More places. I just needed a coffee, something to keep me relaxed. Maybe a glass of red wine.

So after I asked I found a coffee shop, near a hotel in a small cafe. Many people were in and out of there in a hurry. They carried all kinds of drinks, mostly with sugar taht I couldn't eat or drink. It's bad for the heart but you need it, sometimes you need it. But none of them actually needed it.

It was only half an hour I sat there, I bought my coffee and some biscuit pastry. The people were out and about. Those in the cafe sat restlessly, checking their time, peeking at their newspapers or magazines, then away to eachother, to the crowd.

At 




























I leaned against a train platform pillar while I waited, humblely. It was late and people were draining the station gradually, trickling drops and drips.

It was an still is a huge station plagued with space but he was so engrossed in himself he didn't see where he was going until he ran into me. Excuse me, I don't remember how the conversation started. But half way through, "you look like a Mexican I know."

Quite surprised, and for some reason offended, I asked, "A Mexican?"

"Yes, he used to come in the city. I usually don't come up this far north."

"Yes well," I began but he interrupted.

"You see I take the train only for work. I like to live out in the suburbs, near Jersey where it's far cheaper. Everyone likes it better there. You have room to run around and it's far less hectic. You also have Bruno's, it's a nice bar..."

"What's so nice about Bruno's?" I asked.

"Oh Bruno's? It's a very practical place. Listen let me buy you a coffee or a beer. Something."

My friend was not going to show up, so let me entertain myself with a few thoughts from this man.

"Sorry I'm Gerald. What's your name?"

"It's Horace. Everyone calls me Horace. They always ask me if I'm Irish or Italian. But i'm not Irish or Italian. Or Polish!"

We found our seats at the bar, and teh bar tender, recognizing Horace, did a nod and immediately brought over two very cold beers, almost frozen.

"Are you going to ask me if I want to go in on your pyramid scheme?"

He looked blankly at me, "No! Can't a guy just have a drink? A drink calms me down, it relaxes me after a hard day. I'm just inviting you for a drink and you think I'm trying to sell you something? To trick you? Ar you mocking me, how humbel I am?"

"No, sorry, listen-"

"What's your problem, seriou-"

"Listen, sorry. Let's start again. I've just been in a situation before where this happened, I was half joking anyway. Listen, let's start over."

He calmed down, sinking into his seat and his beer. I didn't dare tell him I quit drinking years ago, I didn't dare at that point. I was worried I'd scare the creature back into the darkness.

"It's fine, it's ok. Just like, people don't usually talk like that. Someone made a racial slur at me once. I was digging up some info on my great grandfather, at the library, and someone overheard me. My conversation with the librarian."

He laid out the position of the players with his hands, "And he asked me, 'Senteeza? Are you some kind of Jew? That sounds like a true Jew name.' And I just looked at him in disbelief. What kind of name is a Jew name? So what if I was a Jew, which I am through my great grandmother. I stared at him until he said, 'Are you Jewish?'"

I stared at my bottle. They made that beer a few miles from here, across the river. A local beer. A local man?







...

"I knew a guy who used to steal almonds from work. His work had almonds as snacks. So he'd steal them! He stole the almonds. I mean no wonder California has a draught." He laughed a bit, his jowls and belly shaking.

The monotone was slowly getting to me.

...




He loathed identification, because it didn't tell his entire story. His face, he thought, looked like a mugshot. People often mistook him for other ethnicities, and he enjoyed it. An American but from Italy, from Germany. A Bulgarian American, only the great great great grandson of a Bulgarian American.

He told me I didn't understand, or it was just difficult for me to understand? What he had been through. Difficult. 

"We are tribes."

"Tribes?""

"Yes," he closed his eyes solemnly, "Tribes who follow religions, ideologies, cults, none of them matter." He held his coffee close, his shoulders were tense but the rest of his body relaxed. When he spoke one of palms opened up in a gesture as if he were physically pushing his ideas forward. But I watched his hand again and again present me nothing.

"That's why I love America so much. The idea is beautiful. Everyone abandons their past, gets together and recreates themselves in any image they want." His hand went up, painting their images in the air.

"Aren't Americans a tribe then?"

"Well, yes of course we're a tribe. The American tribe. The great American tribe. We all chose to be here and that, THAT" he knocked hard on the table "is an American."

"Well the native indians are Americans too."

"Well of course, and they are so lucky to live "

One day though he disappered. I hadn't seen him in weeks. Not slinking across the streets. No exagerrated expressions and full of banter. I admit, I began to worry.

A body was found of someone. The evidence showed the body was heading home but was caught in the middle of a shoot out. An unintentional or intentional bullet hit him directly in the face, effectively exploding its details. No one was there to witness the assailants.

Being dead, the body made quite an impression now. I myself even came forward to try and identify it, but it was impossible. What remained was very disguting. The figure was unrelatable.

A charity took pity and volunteered to bury him. They marked the grave with their churches' symbol, and on his gravestone were the two letters D and D, standing for deary departed.
