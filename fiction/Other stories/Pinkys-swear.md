Pinky's Swear
 
The Colonel was caught up with the facts. He arrived in a black tweed suit, his rank on his chest and a gun in his pocket. His head was clean shaven, and he scanned the crowded lawn across the cemetery devoid of expression. Standing like a lighthouse in front of a sea of marked memories by his old hometown's folk.

ALl of the mourners stood in their small groups. Some surrounded his mother's casket, some a flower patch or a bench. Each moved together except the Colonel. He knew they remembered him as squat, plump, round and poignant. They knew him as Pinky too, because that's what his mother called him since the day he was born.
 
"This is where her past lived," he said to himself. "It's just unfortunate it happened for so long."

He cast quick glances. Half of the crowd wore dull comforting smiles, others he saw looked mortified. That's when he knew these were amateurs. They all gave their condolences to Pinky. Their apologies lingered in his ears as he weaved through the crowd, nodding. He found it amusing to himself to not say a word. His silence went on until he reached his father.
 
The rock that Pinky remembered as his father's face was now molten and weathered with crevices of skin. Few thin gray strands lay across his head. He hunched, not a mountain anymore. The years were not kind to him, even abusive. They exchanged a few select words, those saved after exhausting the rest in shouts during Pinky's adolescence. His father's sentences were hard, shallow but grief stricken. Pinky took them in numbly. Each of Pinky's replies all dotted with 'sir's.
 
((His mother's funeral cast a long and abysmal shadow on him. It was enough to at least knock on the door of his insecurities.))
 
As he sat in front of where the procession was about to begin, he felt someone shift besides him. He did a subtle double take out of the corner of his eye. A bearded man topped with a pork pie hat squinted under the hot sun. Pinky wanted to shove the pork pie in the man's face. "Some people have no shame, even annoying the dead with their idiot costumes." But he held back, commandeering.
 
"May I ask how long you've been in service?" said the pork pie hatted man, catching a glimpse of Pinky's medals.
 
"Twenty three years." recited Pinky with bland enthusiasm.
 
The man pulled out an old stopwatch after fishing deep in his jacket then sighed. He clicked it open and read, as if he were reading Pinky's resume. "You enjoy it, I hope?"
 
"It's for the service of my country and countrymen. There's no higher honor." 
 
The man smirked a tiny but indiscreet smile into his watch. Then with a deeper sigh, "Honor." He repeated.

Easily a hundred people hushed their children as the procession began. Everyone was quite ready to get on with it, licking their chapped lips in the heat.
 
Pinky's mind drifted as the silence enveloped him. He pondered the sea of gravestones behind the podium, "What is this mood I'm in?" He asked himself.
 
"Melancholy maybe?" The man with the pork pie hat whispered.

"Melancholy?"
 
"It's kind of a cycle, I guess. It's terribly depressing, but that's beside the point. The entire atmosphere is depressing after someone dies. The mere image of the casket poisons the air, gets us intoxicated."
 
"What are you implying?" Pinky's face reddened.

"Did she even want to be buried here? Would she care if you were here?"

"WHA-"
 
Pinky's father tapped the microphone on his hip like a maestro and raised it like a magician. He coughed, aiming it at Pinky. Pinky obeyed but with clenched confused fists, staring back at the pork pie hatted man with vicious eyes, then giving him the finger. The pork pie hatted man did nothing.
 
Pinky's father began doling out his introductions like the catering working in the background. One at a time he brought out memories, the quality of each was questionable. Everyone sat comfortably, except Pinky, as his father picked off names and hammered them into a scenario with his mother.


"What is this old moron saying?" he muttered and tried to focus. He was still hard pressed to dismember the pork pie man verbally. The man watched his father patiently with a sad pouting face. He could intimidate him easily, Pinky thought. He had his gun on him too.

A young blonde girl waddled into Pinky's view a few feet away. She hid behind a few chairs from an invisible opponent playfully but in tears. Pinky watched her a bit. She wore a faded pink dress with an assortment of frills. The toddler took a few steps closer. Her wide green eyes gushed with tears falling off her cheeks. He motioned her away but she remained stationary.
 
After his father finished he called for the next condolences. Pinky held his own but still he felt antsy. With each seventy or eighty year old figure their middle aged son or daughter escorted them slowly like a laggy parade.
 
"She was an angel. Just ask Mrs. Cusak... Right Peggy? Do you remember how many times she helped us with our gardens? She stuck it out even in the heat. Always bringing her pie when she visited on Sundays too. Every damn time she had to bake that pie that morning before she came over... Can you taste it Peggy? You remember that pie? We take that pie to heart. I was sick of it by the end honestly, it might be what killed her too!" then smacking the air dryly, "Ah no, that's my joke."
 
Others, like his scoutmaster Mr. Tofall was all smiles besides his tears and warts.
 
"I'm sorry..." the toddler in front of him whispered.
 
"Go away," he whispered back impatiently through his teeth fanning her to leave. Again he motioned the girl, but she only moved closer. He looked around for a neglecting parent, but couldn't see anyone claiming her.

His forehead began to bead sweat from the hot sun. But suddenly a feminine hand materialized dobbing it with a cool handkerchief. "Who-" Pinky began, realizing he was so startled he was ready to jump out of his seat. She placed her hand on his shoulder. He circled to see a brunette's long dark hair brushing his back. Her face was obviously hot from the sun, but her gaze was distant. 
 
She slowly began petting his head. Her cool palm rubbed his skull softly like drying expensive silverware. Her other hand caught his before he could reach out to her, and she looked in his eyes. They smiled sadly into his, but they calmed him. Her finger pointed at his nose, then on his lips. The crying little girl's whimpers were becoming more grating to him, a soft but sick rhythm.
 
"Shhhh."
 
"Do I know you?"
 
"Your mother is in a better place." She whispered to him, massaging his arm.
 
"Please, I'd rather not talk about my mother." Pinky said.

The lady sighed then stared into the beyond, as if she were blind. "It's hard not to talk about it now."
 
"Can you please be quiet," He whispered, lulled by the sun and her hands, he closed his eyes "We are at a funeral." He could hear Mr. Tofall's hard voice breaking down. His slow sobs steadily grew more in focus. His voice almost broke the lulling spell Pinky was under.
 
But what actually did was how pressure from the brunette massaging his eyes. She carelessly pushed them hard into his aching head. "Softer please," he whispered, but she ignored him. He felt marbles borrowing in his sockets. He grabbed her hands and raised them forcefully.
 
He realized just then he'd lost the feeling of the gun in his pocket. Feeling naked without it, in a sudden panic he got up. He was faced to face with her. Her eyes were still dreamy, somber, as if she were about to faint. She looked sad, and he realised she irritated him incredibly.
 
"Did you steal my gun?" He talked over the crying toddler's wails.
 
"Do you need it at your mother's funeral?" She sighed in a daze.
 
"I need it everywhere. Did you steal it? I'll have you arrest-"
 
"Calm down now." The man with the pork pie hat snapped his fingers, "There's no need for violence here."
 
"I'm the law here, whoever you are. You'll address me as-"
 
"As what? Your mother is lying there dead in her grave. You're here pretending you care about her."
 
The toddler wrapped herself around his leg, her face draining her tears into a puddle on his pants. "What the he-..." he swatted at her, but redirected at the brunette and the man in the pork pie hat.

"What the hell business is it of yours?"
 
"It's _your_ business." The man muttered, staring straight at him. "You don't deserve a salute Colonel."

This only made Pinky madder. His face was already pink from the heat, but it lit further like a burner. All his military restraint couldn't hold him back, and he grabbed the pork pie man by the collar.
 
"Who the hell are you?"
 
But as he blurted it out a pain stung him in his ankle. The toddler began first with small nibbles but then hard bites piecemeal, teeth mark holes ripped through the seams of his socks. Blood drooled down his shoe soon enough.  The brunette lady got behind him, peppering his shoulder with spit. She climbed on his back as he turned in circles trying to grab her or her dress. She bit at his sweaty red neck.
 
"Get off me!" He yelled out. With Pinky off guard, the pork pie man grabbed the back of one of Pinky's arm and twisted it hard with great strength.

"Get off me! I'll have you bastards arrested."
 
"You're at your own mother's funeral." The pork pie man hit him in his stomach, knocking out the wind in Pinky while the other two flailed around him. "Show... Some respect... For your mother."
 
"I'm a damn colonel you bitch. Get off me!" He tried to hook his arm around the brunette woman's head, anything to get a better hold of her, but she slipped out of his sweating palms' reach and he screamed in pain as he felt her teeth grind on his ear. Pinky fell to the ground while the toddler began gnawing on his right knee. 
 
He kicked at them until got his footing, and managed to pry the brunette off his back, then dragged the little girl against the dry grass from his knee. Staggering to get up, the man with the pork pie hat put him in a headlock. "Your mother was a saint, she was always there for you!" he yelled, kneeing Pinky hard in the stomach.
 
"My mother..." Pinky huffed. "I'm so glad she's dead. She understood how much I hated her-" And with a punch to the face the pork pie hatted man was on the ground having his hat fall off. "She only cared about herself and her stupid neighbors and friends. She was never there for me."

And while kicking the child, Pinky screamed clearly "You can all go to hell like her!"

The swear ran through the garden gallantly like an olympic triumph. Pinky suddenly realized what he had unleashed, and to his horror the wrinkles and aghasts on people's faces were petrified. Their glaring eyes and wide mouths stood stone white for a moment.

The whole world stood still. His words dumped all his worth into oblivion, and he stared down at them as they fell, mouth agape. He reached out, but his his hands were too far greased with sweat. So they only strained through his fingers.
 
Sensing a familiar presence, Pinky knew before even looking that his aunt was staring right through him. Without a word he heard her judgements immediately. The family! Our Town! Your humility! 
 
His father stepped up behind the formed crowd. He was distilled in agony. "Why, son?!" He mouthed, overstruck by grief. Pinky tried to say something, but his father's hating eyes froze those words and nailed them deep down his gullet.
 
Who accompanied his father but two of Pinky's kindergarten teachers! Their arms hooked together just moments ago, soon fell to their sides. One raised her hands to the sky to ask in a prayer to the past moment, how could he tarnish, how could he be such a horrible child?
 
Right behind them though, was his high school class queued up. Their ears perked at Pinky's descent. They had exaggerated surprised expressions on their faces with slightly curled smiles.

A parade of cousins, uncles, family friends, teachers, butchers, shopkeepers, mailmen, carnival game touters. The town's parade battered at him, their stares flogging him, one blow after the other.
 
And then his mother appeared before him, her face paler than snow. Her body was frail, writhing in agony of disappointment. She wore a particularly ugly dress with its own brand of horror. Unfashionable even in death, it made him even more depressed. It was enough to melt him. "How could you..." the ghost whispered silently in the hot still air, then evaporated.
 
***
 
His face lay in the shade of his mother's tombstone. His hands were red with calluses. They stung from pulling at people's shirts, suspenders and dresses begging for forgiveness all afternoon. He was too tired and cried too much to be useful to anyone. Leaving him there was the least they could do after he begged for their forgiveness. To let him sulk without dignity.

"This yours?" And with a thud a gun landed on his chest. He held it with his smallest finger, the only finger that hurt the least.
