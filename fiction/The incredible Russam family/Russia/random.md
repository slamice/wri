Zain woke up in a barn with the distinct smell of horses. He opened his eyes and saw he was asleep in a clump of hay in one of the stables.

He was about to get up but then he heard a door creak open. Someone was walking straight towards his stable. He tried to stay calm and not to move. Maybe the horses will distract whoever it is before he leaves? He waited and tried not to breathe.

Suddenly, in front of him, two huge chicken feet appeared at the door. He saw how sharp the claws were, how big the feet were and screamed.

The owner of the chicken feet then appeared. It was a very old woman with long whispy white hair. "Lotion." she said flatly.

"Lotion?" Zain asked.

"Yes, I know what you're thinking. You saw my feet. I know you looked at them." She snarled, "All they need is a bit of lotion, that's the problem."

"Really?"

"Of course. I can't be bothered with that now though. I am far too busy to worry about loion."
