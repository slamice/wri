ch7. The Byside

"We are from a long line of inventors and builders. Our name last names have changed over the centuries only to keep track. Husk is a bastardization of a french word which is a bastardization of an Arabic name which is bastardized from Sunskrit, etc.

"Builders are people who can build anything. They held onto their skills from Europe and Asia and south America and shared them with native Americans, some handed down from generations and generations back. As you might know it takes a lot to build a good home, and they took it to heart. So when they were together they could build anything. Ove rteh centuries they carved houses out of mountains and laid stones and brick to build tiny houses or huge pyramids. These are all secrets they shared together, each with their own role.

"A long time ago, hundred of years ago when houses and small cities were getting built, the people building those houses were poor. The builders, architects and inventors for every building built was tired. They were exhausted after constant planning and building for less than a few cents while the richer classes enjoyed them. They didn't care for how much effort and love that went into a place, but they did care that it was theirs afterwards.

"((A thousand years ago?)) So a suggestion was made among the builders to the Richer classes. The builders proposed that they build the houses in exchange for owning their own or avoiding paying rent to the owners. This was a bold suggestion by a famous Husk who was full of bravery. Unfortunately he was dismissed and smitten dead. The rich wouldn't have any of it.

"So two factions of teh builders formed. One decided to ride the tides, stay and try to make grander and grander buildings for the rich, architects getting fancier over time to entertain to and dazzle. Architectures and a variety of different themes got created.

"The other faction decided though that they had enough. It was a famous Husk who suggested thet they go underground and be at peace, far away from everything. So that's where we went. And we kept quiet about it, disappearing suddenly in the night to build our futures underground. 

"The rich got worried, and decided to hunt us down. Everywhere. Anywhere tehy found us, they would hunt us. So initially it was very hard to hide. Until they came to a deal.

"Houses began to depend on things internally. Pipes and plumbing and building infrastructure would break all the time internally. So if we agreed to maintain their houses, forever, we wouldn't be chased down. So we signed the agreement. We have the copy and signature of multiple dignitaries around the world from hundreds of years ago.

"However, we prefered to stay quiet because of our inventions. We knew that if people got a hold of them, we'd be persecuted all over again. Everything would fall apart. So we stay underground and never let anyone in. The last reported incident of anyone coming or leaving was one hundred years ago. We've sealed everything. Everytime a building is demolished or destroyed you can guarantee at least one more family's house is destroyed. It folds in on itself and we run. It's getting harder to know before buildings are destroyed, but we always rig warning signs.

There are still classes among us. We are poor when we cannot afford education or food. Our house is free but we die anyway. So we are always fighting for our survival."

"However," Mr. Husk turned to Zain, "Something has changed. Somethign so remarkable, I can barely imagine it. I heard something through the pipes. I couldn't help it. Well, we use steam and fire and combustion and water to power everything. What we need is electricity. But we are forbidden to take anything and be as undedectable as possible. UNLESS... It's free."

"Free?"

"I overheard that one of the few benefits your family has is that the power that you use, your Dad uses, is that some of it they don't charge for. I don't know anything about how power plants make electricity, but I know how money works. This would change our lives, the entire lives of the BySide. There is a contest the mayor put out to construct a workable electric device and teh intricacies on how it works. If you coudl help us, I'd be eternally grateful."

















"We are sworn to stay here. We cannot leave. Even if we wanted to," And he stared at Josslyn with his words, "it is stritly forbidden by threat of cramped smaller space, imprisonment or sometimes death." Josslyn tried not to look at her Dad at all, pretending to busy busy with the map.

((Have to tell Zain about the three magic elements otherwise he might be suspect.))

((Zain disguised as a Londoner through the tube, rich with money.))
