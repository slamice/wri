"No." The girl's voice said. It sounded more like 'Nao', a bizarre accent.

"Yes! You have to give that back! I know where you live!"

"But I ne~ed it!"

"You can't just steal things you need!"

But there was a pause, and the light inside shut off and the girl's eye was no longer looking out at him.

"I'm going to come back and bring someone to break your door in."

"How did you get in here anyway?"

"Through the wall, just like you."

There was another pause, then a scrambling. She unlocked the door and it opened, but she pushed Zain out of the way as she shut it holding a sack rushing back up the tunnel.

"You're in big trouble." She yelled back.

"Hey wait!" Zain yelled, following her.

The girl pulled out a rusty paint scraper and dipped it into some clear liquid from a jar. She covered the crack the wall had and it sealed in and the tunnel turned to black. That was until two bright lights turned on next to the girl's goggles.

"What's so important about your stupid ruler?" The girl asked, scrapping the wall even while it was smooth.

"It's not stupid. I wouldn't tell you anyway. Where is it? And how am I suposed to ge- WHO ARE YOU?"

The girl turned around with a contorted angry face. "I'm sorry." She said quietly, "but I don't need your ruler. Well, I need it, but actually, I need your help." ANd she passed him and went down the tunnel.

Zain, understanding less about what was going on by the minute, tried to push the wall back to no avail. So he followed her before she was out of sight, feeling his way down the tunnel.

"Give me back my ruler."

"Shhhh! You'll have to be a bit quieter than that." The girl whispered quite loudly.

"Well, we couldn't help but notice your Dad works at the power plant. And as per his working there, he gets his power, to an extent, for free."






"We also know the side people, like us when we have them, value their neighbors. It's the power of being neighborly. Please, if you would, help your neighbors."

They both smiled in unison, as if on cue, and looked long at him.

 

"I understand it's a very heavy thing to ask. It's unfair that we are desperate I know. But desperate people do..." he leaned in closer, "desperate things."

They have moved the main source of their metal maybe from queens to staten island?, and plastic sucks.













Summary: Mr. Husk explains the situation, how he needs electricity in exchange for showing him the city, gives him some rare food.
----------

Secret of the masons is the glue that colors and holds together cracks instantly.

Mr. Thander looked at him blandly then smiled, "Myboy Zain, of course to save space. Space... Is of unimaginable value."


...

"Well, if you can imagine, there was a time when everyone lived together. We started creating these buildings, building you see all over. We are the original masons.

We formed comittees and guilds for builders, but teh government always struck us down. We feel we gave it our all, to washington, to Jefferson, to all of them. But we were the bottom rung, and on top of building our own homes we had to pay rent for them.

So a silent revolt formed, then a very loud revolt, and a whole slew of us, hundreds if not thousands, were to be hung and guillitined for our dignity. Can you imagine! No you cannot imagine.

But a few of us, one day before the killings, decided to make a deal with the government. A deal that's been made thousands of years, as long as the masons built buildings. We decided to maintain the internals of structures, so they wouldn't mold or collapse, in exchange to be left alone and forgotten.

This was a very easy deal ot be made. Less mouths to be fed, while enjoying the splendor of masonary construction. At first it was quite difficult, but we had a few things that the governments and the landlords did not have. And tehy should never have, because then we'd be ruined all over again.""

"Some Dodo?"

Zain was stunned, "This is real Dodo?!"

"Yes well, you weren't using them, so we took them in. Like all the other animals you threw away. So we took them and they were put to use. I think they're much happier here."

The meat tasted like an equisite ostrich, something Zain had never tried. But he felt like he did, and it felt like something even better.

A shadow grew over him

-----



Zain knows all about extinct birds and stuff. So he's surprised they eat extinct pigeons.

"This is in, stout you throw out ((melt down??))"

The entire city rumbled and bustled. Many gears moved and doors slid by in quick succession as they moved about. Doors slid by his right and left and people popped out and walked immediately in front of him, or snuck behind him in a hurry. People walked on the ceilings above him, some with backpacks. Some had babies right side up in their backs with the carrier upside down. They moved swiftly, almost in eerie quiet. But it was impossible, due to the small space and narrowness, not to bump into a pipe, or hit a door, or kick a can.

"Of course it's not enough! Why would it ever be enough?"



"Because you get stuff and then you have it?" Zain asked.



"But then it chips, or it's old and you want another one."

Zain looked up and there was a girl. She had a huge yellow sweater on that said "1947 Wheeties", long straight black hair, a blue patched jean skirt and leather boots. But the thing that struck Zain were her very thick round glasses. And she was holding Zain's ruler.

"Hey!" Zain screamed. He stuffed his backpack as quick as he could and took off running after the girl.

She flew around a corner in a hurry and zain was only two seconds behind her. But when He turned the corner, the girl had vanished completely. It was just an empty sidewalk, with absolutely no one around.


Zain couldnt believe he was going to lose his grandmother's ruler. He had never been robbed before, and was still in a panic. He walked a few feet ahead of him and noticed something odd.

On a white brick wall, just like any other wall, but it looked like it was flapping just a bit back and fourth. Curious, he pushed it. And instead of a rock hard surface, he fell right into the wall.

Zain didn't really think about where he was, or what he was doing, or how dark it was. All he cared about wad his ruler. And he follow what he thought was the girl's breathing. First he was crawling through a small tunnel, then he stood upright in a very narrow wooden cave.

He heard a door slam and lock, and as he turned a corner he saw it. The door and fit within the walls cracks; it was crooked and as narrow as his body. There was no knob, only a very large key hole. It looked really old, and was covered in English letters that formed nonesense words. He took no time to bang on the door, "Give me back my ruler you theif!"

He heard some scuffle inside, like something moving around in a panic. Something clicked and a light turned on. In tke keyhole he could see a magnified eye looking back at him. (eye hole on doors have fisheyes or types of inverted glass)

"No." The girl's voice said. It sounded more like 'Nao', a bizarre accent.

"Yes! Yuo have to give that back! I know where you live!"

"But I ne~ed it!"

"You can't just steal things you need!"

But there was a pause, and the light inside shut off and the girl's eye was no longer looking out at him.

"I'm going to come back and bring someone to break your door in."

"How did you get in here anyway?"

"Through the wall, just like you."

There was another pause, then a scrambling. She unlocked the door and it opened, but she pushed Zain out of the way as she shut it. She was hurried holding a sack. Instead of glasses she wore huge goggles with lights on their sides. She rushed back up the tunnel. "You're in big trouble." She yelled back.

"Hey wait!" Zain yelled, following her back.

The girl pulled out a rusty paint scraper and dipped it into some liquid from a jar and covered the crack the wall had. It sealed in and was completely dark with 

"What's so important about your stupid ruler?" The girl asked, scrapping the wall even while it was smooth.

"It's not stupid. I wouldn't tell you anyway. Where is it? And How am I suposed to get out now? And who are you?"

The girl turned around and she had a sad angry face. "I'm so sorry." She said quietly, "this is my fault."

((Does sealant seal itself or does she have to seal it back?))

Zain tries to runaway, falling down trap doors.

"Well, what would you rather we do?" Mr. T asked indifferently.





------------

"We have people dying in the streets! For no reason! They're just walking, to work or wherever, and suddenly they're dead in a grave."

A city within a city.



"You know all the people you don't recognize walking in the hallways, downstairs, waiting outside your house? Or weird noises you cant explain? Theres always an explanation, and now you know."



Mole people wear goggles and used clothes. A long time ago they made a deal to pay no rent in order to keep fixing internal stuff. But places are getting smaller these days, so they do water shortages and blackouts.







They try to make space work everywhere.



E.g. Stairs as table also as neighbour's stairs (walks upside down)
