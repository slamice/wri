Ch1. Moving to the City









"Super illegal. They'd make us move closer to the center, interrogation, whatever."



"Whatever?"



Mr. Thander pulled some cranks, twisted a few knobs. The room started to move again, so they walked around, stepping over various buttons and things before stopping.



"Ok I will explain it. But it's nasty business."



Mr. Thander and Joceline pulled on a few handles from the floor. Up came a table and three chairs, sliding out of slots. From a hole Mr. Thander pulled out a map. It was in white and blue and looked old



"This" he pointed at a square, "is where you live. Your problem," he looked Zain sternly in the eye, "is that you don't live in such a great place. It's we call the BySide. We-" he peeled back a paper from the map ((somehow showing what was in between the walls)) "this is us. He pointed at a this rectangle, "we live in your walls."



"In my WALLS?"



"Yes, in fact," he knocked on a pipe, "this is what you hear from your room."



"You're in my walls?!"



Joseline was ignoring them both, feeling sulky and guilty.



"W



"You see this?" He pulled out a magnifying glass from his goggles, "this here-"



"Why is everything so small?"



Mr. Thander looked at him blandly then smiled, "Myboy Zain, of course to save space. Space... Is of unimaginable value."







They have moved they main source of their metal maybe from queens to staten island?, and plastic sucks.

Zain looked up and there was a girl. She had a huge yellow sweater on that said "1947 Wheeties", long straight black hair, a blue skirt and leather boots. But the thing that struck Zain were her thick very round glasses. Also, she was holding Zain's ruler.



"Hey!" Zain screamed. He stuffed his backpack as quick as he could and took off running after the girl.



She flew around a corner in a hurry and zain was only two seconds behind her. But when He turned the corner, the girl had vanished completely. It was just an empty sidewalk, with absolutely no one around.



Zain couldnt believe he was going to lose his grandmother's ruler. He had never been robbed before, and was still in a panic. He walked a few feet ahead of him and noticed something odd.



On a white brick wall, just like any other wall, but it looked like it was flapping just a bit back and fourth. Curious, he pushed it. And instead of a rock hard surface, he fell right into the wall.



Zain didn't really think about where he was, or what he was doing, or how dark it was. All he cared about wad his ruler. And he follow what he thought was the girl's breathing. First he was crawling through a small tunnel, then he stood upright in a very narrow wooden cave. He heard a door slam 









Zain tries to runaway, falling down trap doors.

-----





"Well, what would you rather we do?" Mr. T asked indifferently.













------



A city within a city.



"You know all the people you don't recognize walking in the hallways, downstairs, waiting outside your house? Or weird noises you cant explain? Theres always an explanation, and now you know."



Mole people wear goggles and used clothes. A long time ago they made a deal to pay no rent in order to keep fixing internal stuff. But places are getting smaller these days, so they do water shortages and blackouts.







They try to make space work everywhere.



E.g. Stairs as table also as neighbour's stairs (walks upside down)








--------------

Zain and the hidden city



"Are you wizards?!"



"Wiztards? Is that a thing in the byside? I'm not aware of it actually."



-----



People are walking on the sides with a trolley or something in the middle.



------



Joceline's Dad's name:



Sordniche Husk?

Mr. Husk is fine



He doesnt know latest names so names his daughter Jocerine instead?







------



Maybe dad works at power plant and gets his electricity for free, so Joceline's dad wants free electricity.



-----



Zain knows all about extinct birds and stuff. So he's surprised they eat extinct pigeons.









----









"We also heard the Byside people value their neighbors. It's the power of being neighborly. Please, if you would, help your neighbors."



They both smiled in unison, as if on cue, and looked long at him.

 

"I understand it's a very heavy thing to ask. It's unfair that we are desperate I know. But desperate people do..." he leaned in closer, "desperate things."





"This is in, stout you throw out ((melt down??))"



-----





The entire city rumbled and bustled. Many gears moved and doors slid by in quick succession as they moved about. Doors slid by his right and left and people popped out and walked immediately in front of him, or snuck behind him in a hurry. People walked on the ceilings above him, some with backpacks. Some had babies right side up in their backs with the carrier upside down. They moved swiftly, almost in eerie quiet. But it was impossible, due to the small space and narrowness, not to bump into a pipe, or hit a door, or kick a can.





------



Living in the bridge pillars



Richer people have more space



Worst insult: "a waste of space."



-----



I dont know ---> Aiunno



Name: Budhnell

Bushnell

-------



Bad guy name: Pompous Grandeur



"The city is already practically bankrupt where do you think the money will come from?"



"You're a brilliant man mr. Mayor. I think you'll find a way."



----





Main bad guy is trying to ransom new york with brown outs (eventually black outs) for money. Could reveal underground, exposing everyone and calling it a humanitarian crisis.



----



Communicate through mikes and shortwave radio.



------



"Of course it's not enough! Why would it ever be enough?"



"Because you get stuff and then you have it?" Zain asked.



"But then it chips, or it's old and you want another one."


----------

Act of forgetting by side ppl is a choice and a violent one. S choice to destroy a ppl you chose to be ignorant over.

------------------------

Your bed is most comfortable when you're not in it

------------------------

"We know, through very kind, unobtrusive means, that you live with your uncle. A very quiet man."

"We barely hear him!"

"Electricity is highly valued but is it mostly classified..."

"Stupendously!" Josslyn made her hands out to look like an  explosion.

"And we wouldn't be asking you if we didn't mean it in the most sincere way possible... We could revolutionize the BySide. With just a touch of it we can improve our lives ten fold."

"Eight million folds!"

"If..." Mr. Husk stopped dramatically. Josslyn popped open a latch from the wall and pulled out a long two pronged cord.

"We could have just a little bit?"

Zain looked at the cord, "you want to steal electricity from us?"

"... Just a bit?" Offered Josslyn.






-----------

Mr. Husk. "There is no such thing as a secret. When something is out in the world it will be discovered. Its just a matter of time. But fortunately people are lazy and don't look that hard."


---------

Mayor's office:

There were rolling brown outs all over the city. This didn't mean that things were brown, just that electrity was cutting out infrequently or the voltage was far less than expected. Two black outs happened, and the mayor was trying to reconcile how they happened. No one knew at the power plants, everything was functional and normal from what they could see. It was one of the many problems he dealt with as a mayor, besides the city being close to bankrupt.


-----------

Summary: Zain's father moved from the country to work at the power plant for money. They move in with his aunt. Zain is 10 years old. A power outage.

--------------------------------

They moved away because Zain's Dad got a job in the powerplant near New York City. They moved in with their uncle in the upper west side so they could get Zain to a decent school. Even though Zain hated school, and much rather would have watched the birds and animals outside, chasing after them to see what kind they were, if they were any rarer than the others. 


----

The only thing he had from his grandmother, which was her father's ruler. It was an old metal ruler, a real old one, but it wasn't rusted because his grandmother took care of it so well.



-----

His window didn't face teh street but an alley that he never saw anyone in. It was between his building and his neighbor's. Just a dark grey empty court with nothing inside.

------

The BySide is poor because so much money goes into concealing, spying and maintenance. Tearing down old buildings doesn't help them.

Zain and the by side

Zain


Zain s parents


Zain s uncle


Nyc mayor


Mr. Husk


Mr. Husk daughter


By side mayor



Stuff in book:


Three lane street bustling


Upside down walking with trolleys in the middle


Eating extinct animals



----

"You eat Dodos"?

"Well you didn't want them so we took them back. They're so friendly you almost don't want to."

The dodo cocked its head and looked closely at Zain, then nipped a bit at his belt. Other dodos laid dormant.

----


Traveling through train tunnels, Zain feels the wind of the passing train

----


The mayor and one of the other inventors are arrested.



After arresting the mayor, deputy mayor banishes Zain from the Byside and Husk and Penelope from communicating with the outside by signature.

Husk looks at it before signing,

Deputy mayor says "husk you're as blind as I am you know you can't read that now."



Mr. Husk moves his shop and house.

(But because by side people's sight is bad in the light, Mr. Husk writes a note on the bottom only to contact Zain under extreme circumstances.)

----


Things at school and home don't change too much. But Zain's parents work a bit less, Zain works a bit more to help them, and they spend time together. Zain is a bit street smarter at school, and focuses on his studies missing the interruptions.



For a year Zain doesn't see anything. He ponders the world and introduces a new kid so he's not alienated.

One night, in bed, Zain sees thinks he sees the rare pigeon again. He runs to the window and opens it, but it's just a normal pigeon.

Out of habit or just a tick, he knocks on the wall.

*knock KnOck knock knock knock*

And hears nothing until, a moment later,

CLANK CLANK

Penelope climbs into his window from a rope.

"I can't believe you didn't notice we painted her!" Penelope says about the pigeon.

"What about the rules?!"

Mr. Husk peers into the window,

"Some things... Are more important."
