Ch1. Moving to the City









Act of forgetting by side ppl is a choice and a violent one. S choice to destroy a ppl you chose to be ignorant over.

"We know, through very kind, unobtrusive means, that you live with your uncle. A very quiet man."

"We barely hear him!"

"Electricity is highly valued but is it mostly classified..."

"Stupendously!" Josslyn made her hands out to look like an  explosion.

"And we wouldn't be asking you if we didn't mean it in the most sincere way possible... We could revolutionize the BySide. With just a touch of it we can improve our lives ten fold."

"Eight million folds!"

"If..." Mr. Husk stopped dramatically. Josslyn popped open a latch from the wall and pulled out a long two pronged cord.

"We could have just a little bit?"

Zain looked at the cord, "you want to steal electricity from us?"

"... Just a bit?" Offered Josslyn.

Mr. Husk. "There is no such thing as a secret. When something is out in the world it will be discovered. Its just a matter of time. But fortunately people are lazy and don't look that hard."

Mayor's office:

There were rolling brown outs all over the city. This didn't mean that things were brown, just that electrity was cutting out infrequently or the voltage was far less than expected. Two black outs happened, and the mayor was trying to reconcile how they happened. No one knew at the power plants, everything was functional and normal from what they could see. It was one of the many problems he dealt with as a mayor, besides the city being close to bankrupt.


-----------

Summary: Zain's father moved from the country to work at the power plant for money. They move in with his aunt. Zain is 10 years old. A power outage.

--------------------------------

They moved away because Zain's Dad got a job in the powerplant near New York City. They moved in with their uncle in the upper west side so they could get Zain to a decent school. Even though Zain hated school, and much rather would have watched the birds and animals outside, chasing after them to see what kind they were, if they were any rarer than the others.

The only thing he had from his grandmother, which was her father's ruler. It was an old metal ruler, a real old one, but it wasn't rusted because his grandmother took care of it so well.



-----

His window didn't face teh street but an alley that he never saw anyone in. It was between his building and his neighbor's. Just a dark grey empty court with nothing inside.

------

The BySide is poor because so much money goes into concealing, spying and maintenance. Tearing down old buildings doesn't help them.
