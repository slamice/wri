Meryl and Linda, a bunch of wise cracking nimnogs, were strutting along the boardwalk in their space regalia when they find some toadies. 

They are inhostile, simply lying around populating the street in piles. Just blocking the streets and sidewalks. People would clean them up but they'd be back again. People would kick them or light them on fire, nothing affects them. They just come back when no one is looking.

A mystery happens. Something is wrong with the toadies, they are not right. What has happened to them?

We have to find out! Says the incredibly tall one.
They go on a madcap search, through the British isles, the Faroe isles, the groccery isles.
They end up at a secret base off the coast of France. Everyone loved it, it was a very scenic scene.
They all get off


A detective is cursing in a roundabout way.







Characters:
- The Fervent (passionate intensity) one
- The ephemeral (lasting a very short time) one
- The indirectly cursing detective.
- Megalopygidae Caterpillar (mustache catapilla)













"We live in a dystopia" Said the Fervent one.

"What the crap is this crap?" said the more ephemeral one.

In the end the bacteria in the air kills the toadies.

"We didn't know they were going to, well, DIE?!"
