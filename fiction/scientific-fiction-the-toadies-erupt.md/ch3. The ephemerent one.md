A reckless ganaching gnashing. She took the door apart with her bare everything. Pieces of wood and shrapnel and lead and barrier stormed into the room. The hinges were unhinged in many ways, shuddering.
"OH MY GOD" she screamed, and we all heard her. She swung open the closet doors and they gasped at her expansive wardrobe of plain clothes.
"COME TO MOMMA" she wailed, and a whale of clothes englufed her. She felt like Gepedo (from pinnocio) only more hopeless.

You have to understand how banal and plain this woman was. The joke was on her, everyday wearing a different shade of grey. Silent movies screamed at her wardrobe it was so hideous. But she was turning over a new leaf, burning down the forest and saving the amazon(s?) while hugging all the trees. Ripping, tearing and ruining her clothes, she sought style where there was none.

They burst and blew into the room like a bomb like a train like a typhoon, soon to blow more. The lighting was as dim as him and it was about to go out. "No time for words" she whispered. "What?" He said. He grabbed her by the ankles and threw her against the wall. She ricocheted off of it and landed on the bed. "What an -animal-" she thought. "If he were a koala hed bite my head off". As she said this pieces of plaster trickled down over her like pennies being poured over a very rich pour guy. "Youre such a brute" she mewed, teasing the concrete out of her bangs. He coughed a little and said "What?".

He thought for a bit and he was done for the year.

"Thats just a sexcuse!" She screamed.

...


"Can't... We... Just... Be..." She huffed as she kicked him out the window. She finally kicked her enough and he crashed through the window as she screamed "Friend?!"

He fell to the street onto his head and was bleeding greatly ((not badly)). He looked back up and made a phone sign with his hands.
