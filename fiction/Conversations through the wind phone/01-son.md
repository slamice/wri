    Enlivened by a descriptively rich passage from the probably unmatchable Patrick O’Brian, incidentally set on board a British warship in 1812, that begins—“The young moon had set, and (the stars) blazed there in a velvet sky, hanging,  he would have sworn, at different heights, with Mars a startling red among them. A certain refreshment rose from the sea,  a damp exhalation almost cool, and Stephen walked forward across the space amidships where in ordinary times the boats stood on their chocks (. . . ) There was a continual living sound of blocks heaving, the strain and slight creak of wood and cordage, the hiss and ripple of and surge of water . . . “ —I thought it would be worth trying to do something roughly of the kind:
     A sense-registered, atmospheric page, someplace outdoors, not in a city (unless it's a park, if you must), with someone in it—first person, third, second, as you like—experiencing and observing, breathing the air, seeing, being in it, percipient and alive.
     How about that?

Kenji Miyazawa



Otsuchi Iwate


















The four hour drive from Shiga to Otsuchi felt longer than his usual drives. 
He drove back and forth for his job, but this time he'd stop by his childhood home to remember his mother. 

Years ago he unbearably sifted through all the photos at the government office silent from fear that his mother would be the next, or the next one, or the one waiting at the end. But none of them were. The world swallowed her and her house whole, threw up some rubble and it was a cruel world.

When he visited as soon as he could, he braced himself for the depressing and was given it in promised heaps.

A boat was docked on top of a house.

((Kenji put his mind at rest how bizarre the concept was going to be. There was nothing bizarre about it. After the tsunami they found few bodies. And those were unrecognizable to a mourning toiling grief of a man. He 

He passed a ship docked on a roof.))






He found out recently form a relative that a man lived on the outskirts of town, a gardener who lost his cousin to the tsunami. To grieve he erected a phone booth in his backyard with a disconnected phone and a notebook. Many of the sixteen thousand mourners made their pilgrimage to his house to pay their respects and get their last words in.

Insisting it was a sincere gestured, his wife and him had many arguments about it. He insisted it was an insult to her memory and a waste of time to cry into a phone. But he was really afraid of talking to his mother again. Without her knowing, he decided to take an extra long journey after workon a weekend to drive the hours it would take to get to the pacific ocean.

At each stop he carried his long list of regrets back to his car, careful not to let them fall over. Tucking himself and all of them in, some in the glove compartments, others on the floor of the car, some sliding over his shoulders as he lifted the brake, he drove it up the gardener's hill to pay his respects.

He climbed the hill up to the gardener's home. His house was enamoured with flowers, shrubs and other plant tomfoolery. Before he was at the top the gardener came out with a hoe in hand and noticed him coming up the steps





"Hiroto chan?" She called out. Her voice was clearer than any phone Kenji ever heard before. It must have been a greater carrier but no one was really taking advantage of it most of the time.

Kenji couldn't breathe. She repeated the name in earnest and hope and Kenji heard it in some recess or his mind until it opened the door past his meandering shock to a formulation of reality. It could be a prank call, 

"Yes?" He answered.

"Is this Hiroto chan?"

"Yes, yes. This is Hiroto."

"Hiro chan you scared me."

"Who is this?"
























The next morning Kenji drove back early across Shiga in a daze. He was alone twisting through its mountains for a few hours. Everytime the car surfaced above the low lying clouds, Kenji's eyes tried to cut through to the road in the valley below, but they couldn't part the sea of fog. It was thick and went on seemingly forever, with the tops of each mountain peeking through like islands. The sky's azure above it all held only the distant smiling sun.

On one bend before dipping back into the world he braked and curbed. As he got out, his lists of past regrets poured onto the gravel. But he was too distracted to notice anything but the cliff in front of him facing the world. His boots crunched the cold green grass and mountain shrubs as he edged closer, then sat down on the border between heaven and earth.

Without a cigarette he could only put his hands in his pockets and draw in deep breathes of the sky. The cold dewey wind almost tasted sweet. Its whistles and playful tugging at his jacket teased him.

Then, two birds broke through sailing effortlessly over the white pillows. The romance they played with the heavens milked a few tears from his eyes. And for a moment, both the wind and his heart stopped. The silence was both deafening and calming.

Where had she gone, and was she waiting for him?

His wife's warm memory curled up and nestled in his chest. And then, he felt his face smile.

















The deep shades of blue in the sky
The clouds an ocean (Kenji tries to see if his mother was on one of the "islands" peeking above the clouds).







The wind ruffled his jacket. It was the only sound for kilometers.
