The wedding




The autumn weather ruffled us as I walked there with her. The serenity of the situation was dying down but still trying to grope me in all the wrong places.

The lady bug skirt Renee wore bunched at her knees.

The modern couple bore exact resemblance to each other holistically. They met on a boat to the island eight years ago. Their dreams together were spent in cafes, camping, back in her French hometown. She accentuated every mutilated word and he drank them all in, a bit dripping down his beard. I knew everyone, not by name and barely by face.

We arrived almost too late at the park and positioned ourselves behind the Parisian mother. Her brooch slowly ate at her shirt black jacket, but she didn't notice because her nose was pulled up to the sky by a fish hook. She shook, smiling and distraught at her daughter. A single bead of sweat dared not come down her wrinkled forehead.

The ceremony lasted roughly ten minutes. The priest put down his beer and settled on the podium, leaning against a stand for bocce players to keep their score. It was far enough to ignore their game.

The sermon raged socio-political arguments at the church. A few 'likes' and 'hmm's were thrown in for good measure, all the while the couple smiled into each other's faces. Beaming a few beams at their immigrant parents. Some of their friends hung their heads low and their backs were turned out on invisible hooks.

Rice was tossed along with a few slinkies. The headed towards a picnic table full of strawberries, cake and salmon.

Suddenly a traveling quartet arrived. No one claimed them for the wedding, but they trailed up to us slowly. Someone laughed earnestly that this was the bride's French gypsy roots bringing some home with solemn symbols crashing and dancing. The oompa loompa band danced forward and stopped in front of the couple. The finale was a ten second free jazz sax solo, and they held it out with their hands on their knees with wide eyes, almost in tears. No one was speechless and we talked over their looks.





The oompa-loomps band jawed and jeered thick horn drawls and hard drum beats at us. We watched wide eyed, smiling and puzzled.

Thin man Dan walked out in front of us. He was a tall pencil head who played a tenor sax like a gift teasing us. The band quieted their harmonies until it was only him playing. He did a jig soloing to the air, and all at once stopped suddenly. We all clapped profusely at his talent and beret.

"Friends!" He raised his arms. "We don't know you but applaud this hefty wager you're playing with life. We're all with you, but we're gambling just by throwing in our hats," he tipped his dusty top hat off. It landed with a tiny crunch on the grass. Dan paused. A few people glanced at the hat then back at him. "Shakespeare once said in a mixed review play" he bellowed "'All the world is a stage! You get hitched and life's a bitch!' So please let us be your audience and see through it that you have a happy ending."

He finally lowered his hands and presented them to the couple, "Congratulations!"

Everyone bellowed a few hurrahs and shook hands. The rich parents fluttered about with food and berries as the younger crowd lazily sullied up to the food tables. The fare was fairly better than the usual fodder, cellophane unwrapped delicately. Some drinks were poured and everyone's brains started to get lubed up in the middle of the afternoon.

It turned out Renee knew many people here. Marty was an ex-boyfriend and former singer of a sell out band now heading North to work in a hemp factory he's a nice guy you'd like him for sure. Another friend who she fell out of touch with because of a cold war relationship in their English class in University.

"Evangeline!" Renee exclaimed.

A Polka dotted apron skirt with a grey shirt white collar hung off her. Two ear piercings per ear. White socks black shoes. Short short hair. Long eye lashes.







Conversations built on solid partial memories and strong Hey!s became brittle. Feeling like a trophy hanging limply from a hand, I idled away around the park and sulked against a tree. In a nearby shop I almost bought a cookbook, but I could be moving soon so I didn't. My forehead shined and glazed in the bit of sun that made it through that cloudy day.

Another game of boce started up, and the old Italians measured the balls carefully. In the near distance blurred distance tight jeans intermingled with clad steampunk dresses. Renee very slowly walked over to me, and I looked up at her.

"What's up?" Renee stood over me.







She sequined her words into a fashionable sing song "When are we getting married Icy?"
