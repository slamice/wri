Ch11. Wedding + dock fight







The autumn weather ruffled us as I walked there with her. The serenity of the situation was dying down but still trying to grope me in all the wrong places.

The lady bug skirt Renee wore bunched at her knees. ((make her sound gross here))

The modern couple bore exact resemblance to each other holistically. They met on a boat to Govener's island eight years ago. Their dreams together were spent in cafes, camping, back in her French hometown. She accentuated every mutilated word and he drank them all in, a bit dripping down his beard. I knew everyone, not by name and barely by face.

We arrived almost too late at the park and positioned ourselves behind the Parisian mother. Her brooch slowly ate at her shirt black jacket, but she didn't notice because her nose was pulled so high up to the sky by a fish hook. She shook, smiling and distraught at her daughter. A single bead of sweat dared not come down her wrinkled forehead.

The ceremony lasted roughly ten minutes. The priest put down his beer and settled on the podium, leaning against a stand for bocce players to keep their score. It was far enough to ignore their game.

The sermon raged socio-political arguments at the church. A few 'likes' and 'hmm's were thrown in for good measure, all the while the couple smiled into each other's faces. Beaming a few beams at their immigrant parents. Some of their friends hung their heads low and their backs were turned out on invisible hooks.

Rice was tossed along with a few slinkies. They headed towards a picnic table full of strawberries, cake and salmon.

Suddenly a traveling quartet arrived. No one claimed them for the wedding, but they trailed up to us slowly. Someone laughed earnestly that this was the bride's French gypsy roots bringing some home with solemn symbols crashing and dancing. The oompa loompa band danced forward and stopped in front of the couple. The finale was a ten second free jazz sax solo, and they held it out with their hands on their knees with wide eyes, almost in tears. No one was speechless and we talked over their looks.





The oompa-loomps band jawed and jeered thick horn drawls and hard drum beats at us. We watched wide eyed, smiling and puzzled.

Their ring leader, Thin man Dan walked out in front of us. He was a tall pencil head who played a tenor sax like a gift teasing us. The band quieted their harmonies until it was only him playing. He did a jig soloing to the air, and all at once stopped suddenly. We all clapped profusely at his talent and beret.

"Friends!" He raised his arms. "We don't know you but applaud this hefty wager you're playing with life. We're all with you, but we're gambling just by throwing in our hats," he tipped his dusty top hat off. It landed with a tiny crunch on the grass. Dan paused. A few people glanced at the hat then back at him. "Shakespeare once said in a mixed review play" he bellowed "'All the world is a stage! You get hitched and life's a bitch!' So please let us be your audience and see through it that you have a happy ending."

He finally lowered his hands and presented them to the couple, "Congratulations!"

Everyone bellowed a few hurrahs and shook hands. The rich parents fluttered about with food and berries as the younger crowd lazily sullied up to the food tables. The fare was fairly better than the usual fodder, cellophane unwrapped delicately. Some drinks were poured and everyone's brains started to get lubed up in the middle of the afternoon.

It turned out Renee knew many people here. Marty was an ex-boyfriend and former singer of a sell out band now heading North to work in a hemp factory he's a nice guy you'd like him for sure. Another friend who she fell out of touch with because of a cold war relationship in their English class in University.

"Evangeline!" Renee exclaimed.







Conversations built on solid partial memories and strong Hey!s became brittle. Feeling like a trophy hanging limply from a hand, I idled away around the park and sulked against a tree. In a nearby shop I almost bought a cookbook, but I could be moving soon so I didn't. My forehead shined and glazed in the bit of sun that made it through that cloudy day.

Another game of boce started up, and the old Italians measured the balls carefully. In the near distance blurred distance tight jeans intermingled with clad steampunk dresses. Renee very slowly walked over to me, and I looked up at her.

"What's up?" Renee stood over me.







She sequined her words into a fashionable sing song "When are we getting married Icy?"

We both knew the answer but were completely ignorant about it.?

Renee and I strolled angrily towards our apartment in silence. As we crossed the large parking lot though Renee changed her expression, Dock was coming back towards us. "Hi Dock, how's it going?" He smiled and waved back, but then stopped suddenly in front of us. A jerky jerk.

Dock suddenly turned withered, depleted, a bit drunk and angry. He decomposed in front of us rapidly like a drying leaf in a vaccuum. "I talked to Gabby, do you remember my ex-girlfriend?" he yelled at the top of his lungs, "and FOUR years ago, FOUR YEARS AGO, you took what was mine." His body flailed and shook. Dock pointed his finger hard at me. "She asked you for a letter, a fucking letter. They sent it to ME, do you fucking remember?!"

Renee's eyes were wide open and the pair were both thoroughly confused. I barely remembered Gaby. Girly, thick accented, lost look in her eyes. Dock woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you." She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

I tried to think back, four years ago. Visiting Dock's house at any time was very uneventful. Dock used to live in a house off campus with a few randoms. Equipped with two floors and a basement, it felt massive. He remembered the kitchen. Fruit flies swam endlessly in circles over the sink, milk jugs in the fridge with just a bit of rotting milk skimming the bottom. One roommate had a neglected pug they were always furious at. Because it shat on their beds whenever it could becasue they rarely walked it.

I thought for a moment, "No, I don't th--"

"LIAR!" He screamed at the top of his lungs, "YOU are A FUCKING LIAR! You're an awful fucking person. You remember she ASKED YOU? You came to my house and she ASKED you to take it. She TOLD ME." He started to tense up, and Renee stepped back.

"I really don't remember, this was four years ago? Did something happen abou-"

"THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT ASSHOLE, You fucking took that letter from ME, from MY ROOM. YOU INVADED MY PRIVACY, YOU FUCK."

"Dock calm down!" Renee yelled, now half concerned half laughing, queerly intent on what looked like the beginning of a fight. A vein or two appeared on Dock's neck and/or forehead or whatever.

"Wait, what was this for? What is this letter?"

"It was her visa so she could stay in the country." Dock hissed.

I tried really hard to remember what I did, and suddenly manifested in my mind an image of grabbing something from the top of a pile of papers. I remembered the request now from Gaby. I remembered I found it odd because she never asked anything of me. The only thing that bound us together was our flakey friends at the time.

"Dock, oh my God I'm sorry, I didn't even think about it, I'm so sorry. But she needed that to stay in the country, no? Were you even dating her th-"

"You violated my privacy," Dock steamed, very pale. "You dented my blood. I was going to use that letter to confront her. But you fucked that up. You fucking asshole, I will NEVER forgive you. You CROSSED ME." And Dock charged at me, throwing a punch in my stomach. It wasn't hard, but the shock was. I felt violated somehow. Dock walked right through me and didn't look back.

"What the hell Dock?!" Renee shrieked, but Dock kept going. I took a step back and tried to understand if I was hurt. At that moment my temper shot up like Renee's ex, and I bellow a scream. "You idiot?! You think you got some kind of revenge? Over some kind of stupid plan you- FOUR YEARS AGO?! You moron! I apologized and you still hit me!"

But dock marched on, standing up taller now, shoulders straight. Dock slowly faded, saying nothing.

"Do you feel good now?! You feel you won something? You coward! Come back and fight this stupid fight like a real man you idiot! ANGUS!"

Renee told me to shut up. Dock turned a corner and escaped from us. Renee whispered, "You know, you deserve that."

A second shock overcame me, "What?!" I shot her a hard look, but it couldn't penetrate anything.

"You know why. He's right, he's a better person than you. You're wrong about so many things but you just don't see it. You're not a nice guy, you need to know that." Her words stood in the air, dancing and stomping hard on my head, then crashed a car into it, sending it hurtling off a cliff. In angry awe I mulled these words over in my mouth like a baby's challenge and finally started to care enough to hate her.

"Are you for real?! Is this real life? Do you understand what just fucking happened here?! Do you _understand_?"

"PERFECTLY. EVERYTHING IS _FUCKING_ CLEAR. Look at _me_, I've overcome so much. He's right." And suddenly she marched home in what I only assumed was some kind of twisted convinced frustration. I stood there in shock.

"You think you're a fucking Pariah? You think you're prudent?"

"Prudent?" pause, "PRUDENT?"

"You think you're a fucking, nice guy? You're an awful person."

"PRUDENT?!" I pronounced slowly in disbelief.



"COME _ON_" She ushered, "COME the fuck _ON_. Let's go _home_."
