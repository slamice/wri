The letter fell to the ground, and I kind of lost it.




Bored as fuck. I've seen these bands. One twice, one thrice, one I haven't seen but I'll probably be disappointed.





Outside, the chain smokers ironed things out with each other. I met some glances that pretended they weren't. They discussed the edge and how the next Music Waste wouldn't survive another year. Venues were getting sparse and landlords were losing their temper for art. Everyone was slowly trying to humiliate them out of town. They sipped their beers and couldn't quite take their tone. Inside the music sped up to a dance rhythm.

The letter in my back pocket was slowly devolving into a sweaty pulp swimming in my pocket. It still read that it was private, and still declared it was from the government.

It grew a bit colder, and I stepped back into the bar.
