The apartment was ridiculously empty. There was only a strewn mess of sheets, my clothes piled in a corner, and a few bottles of spices.


If you have seen one greasy spoon then you get the general idea. But really, you haven't seen them all. There are varying degrees of greasiness following each other.

B_____________, for example, was a legendary diner with high school students and high school student imitators. It was amazing what people will eat. Breakfast is all day, so realistically people are in there around 11 or noon.

While waiting for food you may:
1. Talk about drunken things that happened the night before
2. Stack creamers in a pyramid shape
3. Shake a creamer until it turns into butter, which takes the entire breakfast.
4. Writher in disgust as the waiter give you a jug of water, and at the bottom is one of his punk bracelet spikes.

The food was two eggs swimming in oil, with fried frozen hash browns. That experience was $2.99... So about $3.15 with tax.

Of course the real deal was the greasy spoon that was closest when you wake up. The place was owned by a huge balding man out of the 50's to make it authentically awful, and as white as the toast you ate there as possible.

We went there at 11am, and of course it was crowded because everyone woke up at 11am.

My phone hummed my Dad, and I sluggishly floundered to pick it up.

"Yea Dad?"



I didn't find it necessary
to take responsibility

I'm so tired that I did nothing.
