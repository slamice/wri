The apartment was ridiculously empty. There was only a strewn mess of sheets, my clothes piled in a corner


If you have seen one greasy spoon then you get the general idea. But really, you haven't seen them all. There are varying degrees of greasiness following each other.

Bons off broadway, for example, is legendary with high school students and high school student imitators. It is amazing what people will eat. Breakfast is all day, so realistically people are in there around 11 or noon.

While waiting for food you may:
1. Talk about drunken things that have happened the night before
2. Stack creamers in a pyramid shape
3. Shake a creamer until it turns into butter, which takes the entire breakfast.
4. Writher in disgust as the waiter give you a jug of water, and at the bottom is one of his punk bracelet spikes.

The food is two eggs swimming in oil, with fried frozen hash browns. That experience is $2.99... So about $3.15 with tax.

Of course the real deal is the greasy spoon that is closest when you wake up. The place must be owned by Canadians to make it authentically awful, and as white as the toast you eat there as possible.

We went there, and of course it was crowded because everyone woke up at 11am.
