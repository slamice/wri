The apartment was ridiculously empty. There was only a strewn mess of sheets, my clothes piled in a corner, and a few spice bottles ((put something besides "bottles")).

The winter cold came in and my hands felt chapped and whithered. I itched them constantly because of how dry they were, and the skin crept into corners and bled open small cuts. They began to grow red and chapped. No amount of lotion that I barely put on them could solve that problem. They required maintenance I wasn't ready to give them and I decided I didn't care as much and I thought they'd probably heal in summer anyway.




Selina invited me for breakfast at Bons on Broadway. If you have seen one greasy spoon then you get the general idea. But really, you haven't seen them all. There are varying degrees of greasiness following each other.

Bons on Broadway, for example, was a legendary diner with high school students and high school student imitators. It was amazing what people will eat. Breakfast is all day, so realistically people are in there around 11 or noon.

While waiting for food you may:
1. Talk about drunken things that happened the night before
2. Stack creamers in a pyramid shape
3. Shake a creamer until it turns into butter, which takes the entire breakfast.
4. Writher in disgust as the waiter give you a jug of water, and at the bottom is one of his punk bracelet spikes.

The food was two eggs swimming in oil, with fried frozen hash browns. That experience was $2.99... So about $3.15 with tax.

Of course the real deal was the greasy spoon that was closest when you wake up. The place was owned by a huge balding man out of the 50's to make it authentically awful, and as white as the toast you ate there as possible.

We went there at 11am, and of course it was crowded because everyone woke up at 11am.

My phone hummed my My brother, and I sluggishly floundered to pick it up.

"Hey. I said."

"Hey" he said back.

"It's pretty late there."

"Yea well we're all up."

"Why? What happened? Did something happen to mom?"

"Well, Dad isn't here."

"Why isn't Dad there. Is he ok?" I started to panic.

"He's probably fine. He's not answering his phone though."

"What--"

"Omar. Listen, Mom's asleep, but he left a note. Do you want me to read you the note?"

I hesitated, "A note."

"Yea you want me to read it? I can sum it up for you."

"Ok--" I tried to swallow but my mouth was super dry. "Well, please read it."

--> Dear lovely children,

... mother with Lukemia ...

... leaving ...

My older sister piped up, her voice grew louder and eventually my brother put her on speaker "He's basically selfish. It's probably the most selfish thing you can do. What does he figure? He's a damn coward."

She went on and on. About how he never lover our mother, or her, or any of us. How he worked all the time and his porn habit and his flirting and the fights he and her had. I seriously tried to pay attention to her this time, but my mind trailed off. First it debated reality, then sat wondering what to do.

"We asked the doctor how long she'll be here. They said they could send her home in a week or two but she'll have to come back again."

"You talk to Uncle ((Armenian name))?"

"Yea we did. He's catching the next flight here. He of course offered to take her but I don't know if the hospitals there are any better than the ones here. We're not sure if she can take the plane ride right now anyway. I have to ask are you making good money there?"

"I'm making ok money."

"We're probably going to need it. Sabra d--"

"I have a job but it's not enough." Sabra interjected, "I don't think it's enough. We don't know what's going to happen."

"You can't come back?" he asked.

There was a long nasty pause then.

"It really sucks you're not here Omar." ((Nothing you can do to come back?))

pause.

"Yea I know. I wish I was there."

"We wish you were here too. We're stronger together."

pause.

"We're both tired. We're going to go to sleep and come back here tomorrow."

"I'll give you a call later. We'll figure it out. You think this is for real?"

"Even if it isn't," his voice shook a tiny bit "what are we going to do. Have a good night"

"Impossible. Goodnight." My voice dampened.

And we hung up.

"What? I'm a feminist. He's completely allowed to do that."

I waved an exhaustive "Ok, later." Selina said nothing as I walked down the street. It had a slight hill to it and my feet stuttered down at a bit of a speed.

=============

I'm so tired after doing nothing.

=================

As I was walking away I heard him say something.

"You know she's a whore" Andy's voice said clearly, and I looked back at him and he had a straight face. I could feel him wanting to smile but he was good at hiding it.

((The narrator knows what he said ^ but doesn't aknowledge it.))

"What?"

"Nothing." he said.

"What did you say?"

"I didn't say anything, damn..." and his eyes started to calm and was preparing for a holistic ramble, but I took the pause to physically trail off...

I wondered what just happened.
