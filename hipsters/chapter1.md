There were no curtains on my windows yet, but I somehow slept well into the late morning. I woke up still in a dream while Renee dozed in a really thick sleep deep in a gutter. The bed springs shook as I got up, slowly, and they bit back audibly. Grabbing my jeans from the floor and a shirt from the rack, I slipped off the bed. The cat lay on a pile of our clothes looking up at me, tired and bloated. It watched me wander around the room. With its' eyes it asked me, "why are you awake, that's a pitiful thing to be."

The water pressure in the shower was still way too hard. It sprayed me like an elephant in a zoo, the drops pelting in a rage. Everyday I shaved, but tapped my razor against my hand to empty it. It's because Renee said she could hear the tapping against the sink. It was far too loud and she hated waking up in the morning to my tiny hair spraying against the sink so early. "No one does that, it's incessant and tiring."

He looked for the bag of his socks under random bits of clothes and books. He was late but he started to clean the house. It was the only way to find anything. After shifting the furniture he found a pair. Renee moaned in her sleep but the wake of it was loud enough. He could still hear it as he shut the door quietly behind him.

Outside the recycling station stood solid and people were full at work, trucks driving in and out recycled material, laughing loudly at each other just because. The bottles, cans, tins, broken glass, milk jugs, and whatever else bore a symbol was sorted, tossed and recombined with each other.

He wasn't clear exactly what they did with the recycling besides pack it. Everything eventually ended up in huge clear bags. These people showed off their wealth of trash. One day it'll be useful, but now someone will figure it out.

Past the few warehouses, the territorial crows buzzed on one corner, some above his head. One in particular took to swooping down on him, nearly scathing his hair. He ignored it completely though, it really wasn't worth it. The city was already awake and in full motion. Cars went somewhere in particular. The coffee shop lines were long and the trains were packed. He hobbled through crowds and upstairs. He went further until he pushed open the glass doors of his building. The morning air and slight heat whipped him before the air conditioner gushed in his face.

The walls of the office were painted off hue primary colors. Shy bold statements. And I laid on my desk, most everyone was already there working. The lazy hellos and good mornings were drilled out slowly like a list. My coworkers' clothes were sharp, crisp but not dapper. Lucius wore a tight button up with a wrinkled collar. Tyler distinctively cared less about his dress shirt than the stain on the front pocket. The only chatter in every department were the keyboard whispering their damnest. Every so often a private phone call came to life in a room flung in the corner.

He had to sit, though. He had to think what he was trying to convey. Always preoccupied with nothing specific. He didn't understand, and was amazed people created careers out of it. He thought about how banal it is. People trading paper for things they put on a floor, in a drawer or in a cupboard. He looked around his desk, but made sure it appeared like a nervous itch to not draw attention to himself. People engaged their whole hearts, a bit at a time, monotonously trying to make their work come alive.

Mik walked in the room, "Well good morning!" it came out like a question, and I nodded and smiled back at him. Mik was committed  to creating the most relaxed environment possible. The day proceeded and time was butchered into planning, lunch and more typing. He compiled lists of items and descriptions of them. He drew a few out and threw most of them away.

Our business analyst Ryan sifted through photos. "There is no difference," Ryan interrupted no one, "from hipsters and the homeless. It's really really hard to tell the difference." Tom chuckled and relaxed into a smile.

I zoned out a few times, everyday. To what I couldn't remember. To random things.

Lunch came and left. Four in the afternoon clocked in and left shortly after. I couldn't tell but felt it. We talked over problems. Made micro adjustments. We took ten of them and tore them up all at once. Everyone was terribly excited over these  changes. We all thought, these problems existed to be solved. Driver license systems needed to be overhauled, redone. Pictures needed cropping. Reports needed to be created. Claims needed to be challenged with more data.

At six or so everyone began shaking their things, feeling a bit uneasy. Someone ruffled their coat onto themselves, and then pretended to realize it was time to go.

I packed my things and left. Out the door, into the street, on the crowded train. Past them, past the burden that beckoned me to come back again tomorrow. I didn't meet anyone's gaze, no one did mine. The crows swooped above me. The recycling shop was closed, thousands of bottles and cans snug and sleeping in bags. I shut my apartment door, the cat whining and whining inside. No purring whatsoever.

She didn't leave anything untouched. A huge mess met me with the cat at the door, trying to get the hell out. Boxes unopened, half opened, opened for business, under restoration, national heritage, etc and etc. The room defined askew.

She sat in the bed, topless, the posture and nudity fit a greek aristocratic shelump. What played in front of her was the most unimaginable imaginable television. Horror movies with identical endings, relationship finales foreshadowing later romps.

And yet the irony was ironically built on top of yet more trash. Our apartment was above a shifty limousine dispatch, neighboring a recycling office.

The owners of the place were dodgy themselves. They were cousins from rich Indian families. One who absolutely never ever never for sure ever visited the office. His pictures were all over it with the latest limousine models. The other was his cousin, shackled under house arrest for arranging prostitute rides for political clients. It was in the newspaper one day, on the coffee table in my office. The print read he'd talked behind their backs, calling the prime minister 'little dictator'. I was confused that day if mentioning the prostitutes was somehow clever or not. Oh and he was our landlord.

"How was your day, Icy? What did you do?" a seedless grape slid into Renee's mouth from a bamboo slide.

"Nothing happened today." I murmured.

"Icy can you turn on the washing machine again? I forgot to dry the clothes so wash them again so they don't get moldy."

"Did you happen to check the mail?"

"Ah no, I had to hurry to work today and didn't have time."

I flip through my vinyl and wondered which record would numb effectively. Most are hygenicized, trapped in plastic. The 70's, 80's, 90's underground flip by. Nothing is jarring enough tonight to procrastinate to. So many tears were shed to these new wave, no wave, ho wave. Goosebumps with every listen.
