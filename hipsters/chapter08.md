Ch8. Om takes the cruise. His loneliness plays out here and explains a corporate environment that eludes him.





Michael bailed hard on me. He finally brought up some believable excuse by ignoring me. I couldn't get Renee to follow me on either. Nothing about it enticed her. Her diet was about to hurl at the Hawaiian food she couldn't even think of eating and the alcohol she couldn't imagine drinking.

Alone, I threw away the other ticket and went to the dock ((Some refernece to dock?)) on a Wednesday after work. A plastic Leigh was draped over my head, as if it were knighting me before stepping aboard. I walked slowly onto the yacht, a bit cautious, perhaps overly so, but one can never be too sure can they? I couldn't help but be excited though. I could see the city now from so many angles.

The older men and women had tattoos covering their biceps and thighs, tired of the idle chatter strategy. Their expressions and the color in their faces both ran, drained from conversing a life of tans and cocktails. The tiny younger crowd was vivid, each member giggling but unsure. They wrestled with basic facts, looking out over at the city and neighborhood waters. The buildings sipped the sky and the customer's plastic alcohol cups sipped them. There was a bit more to it but I wasn't paying attention.

A very tan woman turned towards me who looked like someone I barely worked with. She wore a flower dress, the only one prepared to feign for the occasion. She talked about her life, her trip to Puerto Rico, her fame as an athletics event organizer at a local gym years back. She cut our conversation short when a bulky French arm tattooed with a Mohican and a few snakes approached her. Out of the scene now, thoroughly blurred, I went past them unobserved.

The ship ebbed toward the ocean, toward a few islands we were set out to discover superficially. People snapped photos and looked pretty, vacant. It wasn't awkward so much as it was limiting. Past the pineapple sandwiches and fruit rice, once the tiny paper umbrellas unfolded and the rum soaked brownies flowed, people opened up. The bartender popped his collar and gave me an endless flow of cranberry apple juice.

The two girls from Tallahassee working as designers at an robot company. The heavily tattooed developer from Texas who shunned beef after growing up on a pig farm. The two African event coordinators who together came upon a nude beach by accident. Besides shallow descriptions, I didn't find out any other details about their jobs. Even the invitees were seldom found, checking in with people to make sure they were still on the boat. The ship's aimless bobbing to no goal was perfect for us. Our mild conversations took all our attention from the cityscape view and ground it to dust.

An Italian and Jewish pair were huddled in one corner of the boat, discussing their ex boyfriends, their ex boyfriend's dogs and architecture.

"This building is really tall but has those empty floors in the middle. It's earthquake proof right now. That's actually earthquakePROOF"

"Who built it?"

"A Russian architect" she whimpered, "Don't ask me how I know."

The Italian girl chattered away a reply at full force, the other sipped through a straw, looking around aimlessly. It was impossible to tell how much drugs were involved in her demeanour. Perhaps none.

"Are you Italian? I'm Italian." She stared. The sun went down earlier and besides her eyes it got too dark to tell her expression, but you could feel her beaming violently.

"No" I yelled over the growing chats around us. "Do you think I would fit in better if I did?" The Jewish girl flit her head up suddenly to look at me, like a bird, and then away.

"I don't know I don't exactly fit it, like I'm not married yet all my family is married I work at a big company and lots of people just bail on you... During work too, people don't even notice. My whole department, you know," pause, a comment towards the bird "I mean did you see Tony? I've been working past eight all week and he's said nothing. I don't really get how he even has his job. The other day, see... He's never filled out Jonas's accountant forms WE ALL did can you believe _that_?"

Her friend shook her head without regard, "No, I can't." she only looked at her drink.

The ship shrugged and swung in slow motion back to the docks. The riders became excited, lively, bored, full, happy, tipsy, celebrating, a tiny bit seasick. A few final pictures took in the city lights and shadows. The pier welcomed them comely, giving in to their now witless jokes and non-existent drunk charms.

Docked, everyone escaped in a different direction for blocks on end. No one knew anyone anymore except those they came with. I walked home alone, pondering nothing. Cleary though, almost as if it were yesterday. My phone rang, and I remember every detail about my phone conversation with my father on that walk. My thoughts lined up to play back set replies. After coughing a few times I answered.

"Hi Dad."

"How you doing sonny boy? How's the job?" he sounded high spirited. Almost happy.

"The job's fine Dad. Nothing new really. Working hard."

"Yes I know, same old story. Did you get your visa yet?"

"No," I said in anticipation, "I didn't get it yet." He knew I didn't, but wanted to take out any shred of doubt with every call.

"Well listen, I know you want to get it. It's been a long time, we've asked you for a year. We were all hoping you could come down so we can be together."

"I feel it's close Dad. But I can't leave the country until I get it."

"Yes son, I understand. Just it's hard since we won't see you. We wish you lived closer honestly."

I thought for a second, wondering if carefully placing my words was necessary. "it's hard for me too, I've been waiting more than a year and a half. But it's not something I can just leave, I need to finish it." I glanced around and spit in a gutter.

"It's a bad situations I know. Well if your job is good, and you feel you are going up to the next level, it will be worth it. Let me know if you can come soon, we will all be here end of summer in August."

"You will be the first to know when I get it. I won't forget."

"Alright son, it's really late here. You need anything? Ok. Take care."

"Yes Dad, love you." and I hung up.

There was a relaxed tension in our conversation. My family hadn't been fully together in years since I left. ((Knowing they were waiting pushed me to stay...))

My mother used to call me. Once a week I heard her thick Armenian accent telling me she misses me. She must miss us all, I said. My sister married, my brother out of the house. Our conversations became shallow slowly over the years, and soon enough they sounded like short words inscribed in code.

I walked ten more blocks and past garbage after building after loiterer. The city lazily blinked as I got on the metro platform heading to my apartment.

While on the platform, I turned around and the Jewish bird smiled at him, head a bit crooked. I what the fuck jumped, startled.

"Ah you live a few up?" She stumbled a bit and lifted her hand up if she was still holding a drink.

"Barely, did you like the boat?" I asked, a bit coy.

"Yea well, you know it wasn't bad. It was good it was good."

"Did you like the people?"

She took a pause, ignoring me, and stuttered, "Th-there were a few of those, yea."

I thought for a bit, "I mean there were some that were just, I don't know, like, 'in general' people. But there are always a few gems." And I gestured to her, throwing a flirt. But I forgot who I was, who Renee was for just that second. Suddenly the was an accident. Immediately my face embarrassed with my eyes looking away.

We rode the train with a few other direly bored riders. They wore their experiences as if like they were shaken or beaten up. All of them were doing laundry, wearing the shirt they wear on the days they do laundry. I threw a few glances at the crowd, then snuch a few back at the bird.

"I didn't talk too much. You werked a... Sha-me technologies? SHA-ke? La-ke?" She pronounced slowly, stuttering, wavering like a rag on a rustled laundry line (clothespin).

"Lake, yea. But no, remember that. Shake technologies, it's better. Are you alright?"

She smiled wearily, "Yea I'm going to my brother's this weekend. We always fight over the car, but I'm getting it this time," she lifted her index finger high up above her nose, "I made sure of that."

The train shook something off, and as it wavered the bird almost fell into me. I held her balance and got the last scent of her fading perfume. I held her there for a few seconds as she muttered a tiny appreciation and her webby red eyes smiled into mine. The train stopped and she got off chucking a goodbye.

---------- Plot change, Om leaves with Bird --------

But before the doors closed my chest tightened in a mess of guilt and nerves. I stepped out behind her and said "where are you going?"

"I'm going to my apartment." She slurred and wobbled on her legs. She looked at my face and squinted like she was trying to find an object in a painting.

"How about we go for a coffee or something?"

She looked at me with smiling red eyes and crossed her arms, leaning against a pillar and crossing her legs. "You think that's a good idea? You think your girlfriend would be up for that?" She wavered like a leaf about to fall off.

"I just figure you should sober up before going back to your boyfriend's place." My heart beat in my dry throat.

She stood, silent and confused, leaning against a thick subway beam. "Ok, yea that's a good idea why not."

"Why not." I smiled.

"Why naut why naut..." she teased, as I half helped her up the steps.

We went to a diner and we barely chatted about nothing. he head rolled around as she sobered up, all over the table and against the booth. She started bored and forced a few laughs, then eventually real ones.

We bought two coffees in a random greek diner and looked at eachother. Her long nose and her straight dark hair betrayed her bloodshot eyes. Her skin looked cold, but I wasn't about to touch it yet.

"You work for a hedgefund."

"I work for a hedgefund" she replied.

"How do you like it?"

She looked down at her coffee and then up, smiling at me. Her smile reached through my mouth deep into my throat, and clutched my chest further.

So an hour later she was much better, but while we were still tired, we walked down small twisted streets. We found a stoop and rested there before it became awkward.

She told me more about her brother, about her life on long island and when she went to Italy and Austria. New York City was an obvious option, she she aimed for New York. She flailed and writhed until she perched on a branch at a hedgefund as a junior accountant. She's been friends with New York all her life.

At that point I said I wasn't ticklish either, but she reached around my stomach almost fully into my pants and I felt her fingers graze my pubic hair. She continued searching for a twinge or a wince, but I offered her nothing. Her hand was warm and her body leaned on me while I smelled her drunk coffee breathe and hair. She was fully entrenched in finding what wasn't there, any sort of feeling.

"No fun" she puckered her lips and fell back a bit. "Where's your girlfriend?"

With too little hesitation (((make this less obvious))), "I don't have one."

"You're a liar."

"_You're_ a cute liar. Where's _your_ boyfriend?" Wherever is convenient.

"... What do you do again?"

"I don't know didn't I te-, told you twice already."

Pangs of guilt rapped with a crowbar or something against stomach walls, and I felt them ringing. They were thick, heavy and hollow. Full of worry but empty. They piled up in there and stuck, but I tried to use them to my advantage and had them try to fuel my intentions.

We were half asleep though, and after we kissed I gave her a fake number which she lazily swore she'd remember and didn't look back.

Home, I wiped at my face and brow with a napkin to get any scent out. When I came home I went directly to the shower. Renee was on the bed, topless eating small hard pretzels. She asked me how it was and I said great, and she barely did the laundry so she never knew.
