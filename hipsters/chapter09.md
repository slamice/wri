Ch9.

Mik's office, cubed off with designer clout and magic, was a proud achievement of corporate culture. I stood in that office that morning, an obstruction.

We chatted briefly, the morning brightened our conversation and along with it came coffees and teas and toast and jam and kids laughing and subtle nuances it was all going down a long disgusting drain.

He started advising me suddenly, and quickly all his jokes vanished, scurrying scared into all corners of the room. His skin somehow paled further, an incredible feat for a native Belgian. His eyes grew sunken in and hollowed out. The plain stare told me "You need to love what you do."

"I know I can do this."

"The longer you take to figure it out the more time you are wasting." staring at me dead on, I was too caught up and barely noticed his shoulder shrug.

(((Make shrugging have a more prominent yet still subtle meaning, giving up on someone == shrugging)))

"How about we give it a month?"

I looked back at him and again he smiled, "a month, right?"

Walking back to my desk, I smiled back and my heaved a sigh. All the jeans and lattes the world chugged out were thrown to the floor. I saw pathetic coffee cups and free snacks wading down a stream. They were tasteless and garbage. I hope no one noticed and I shuffled embarrassed to my seat, slightly nasious.

My anxieties played and the words and symbols danced the rest of the day around my screen in front of a picture of a mountain top I only just noticed. (((couldn't see the desktop picture)))

It was a slow slog and schlog. I don't remember much that day,
