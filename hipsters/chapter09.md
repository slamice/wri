Ch9.

Mik's office, cubed off with designer clout and magic, was a proud achievement of corporate culture. I stood in that office that morning, an obstruction.

We chatted briefly, the morning brightened our conversation and along with it came coffees and teas and toast and jam and kids laughing and subtle nuances it was all going down a long disgusting drain.

He started advising me suddenly, and quickly all his jokes vanished, scurrying scared into all corners of the room. His skin somehow paled further, an incredible feat for a native Belgian. His eyes grew sunken in and hollowed out. The plain stare told me "You need to love what you do."

"I know I can do this."

"The longer you take to figure it out the more time you are wasting." staring at me dead on, I was too caught up and barely noticed his shoulder shrug.

(((Make shrugging have a more prominent yet still subtle meaning, giving up on someone == shrugging)))

"How about we give it a month?"

I looked back at him and again he smiled, "a month, right?"

Walking back to my desk, I smiled back and my heaved a sigh. All the jeans and lattes the world chugged out were thrown to the floor. I saw pathetic coffee cups and free snacks wading down a stream. They were tasteless and garbage. I hope no one noticed and I shuffled embarrassed to my seat, slightly nasious.

My anxieties played and the words and symbols danced the rest of the day around my screen in front of a picture of a mountain top I only just noticed. (((couldn't see the desktop picture)))

I went to the bathroom. Post lunch, the mirrror wasn't clear, bits of dust and floss aftermath speckled it. A headache was stirring up from the back of my mind. It began reeling, slowly, until it nestled snug right behind my immediate thoughts.

I waved at the faucet to spray out a tiny cold shower of water. It hit my hand but felt at first numb, then very cold. Each drop threw itself dying on my hand, rolling dead down the drain. I wiped my face and kept my hands there. What was wrong with me?

It was a slow slog and schlog. I don't remember much that day,

I thought I'd dillute my shock with Michael, but that's not what happened.

A coffee excuse could work, but when I approached his desk he was hunched over it, in such a deep forboding mood. His fingers heavily smashed down on each key to a black and white screen messed with text. It was a clear sign of frustration to remove all the syntactical sugar, the rainbow of colors that highlighted special parts of the code to aid in development. He stripped down his workplace completely to barely anything to make it run faster. I then noticed, besides his jacket, he threw all his notes out in desperation.

I was seconds away before tapping him on either shoulder but, in a rage, he erected himself furiously to the ceiling and tore the laptop from its cords. He slammed it on the desk again and again, spitting out fuckword after fuckword. A few peices of the machine and his curses flew out to the floor, and neighboring cubicle-ers stared at him in confusion. He walked out miserable right by me to the exit. His laptop lay in a mildly unpleasant electronic heap, a box with a broken frame.

I thought briefly about following him but no one else did. The entire office looked at eachother, mulling over the scene again. Slowly the sounds of typing started up again, and they forgot it.











Surround ourselves with stuff and ourselves, our own egos, until we can't see nature or anything else beautiful. We build our stuff higher.

For business part, we try to build sky scrapers up to the sky to see nature again, but we only see the grey and brown buildings we built, and all the other people trying to get higher too.

Michael is a by product of this atmosphere. He's striving but hates it, and hides his hate behind sarcasm.

(( Make mIchael talk more about his ambitions but frustrations with corporate life throughout the story. ))

Poorer people ride the trains, travelling underground, underfoot from teh capitalists. Real rich people don't get on the subway. They stay high up watching. They encounter the poor and common man on the streets, ignoring them and barely acknowledging them beyond an obstruction, thinking they are an inconvenience.


Does Om want to be one of these people, to raise his kids and have them grow up and hope they don't snub their noses.
