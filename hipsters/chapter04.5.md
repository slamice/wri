I think I walked the length and breadth of manhattan. Well, at least the nicer parts.

Cowboy rollerskater in central park. 

So late at night, I tried to look back at Manhattan from the bridge. But I was flung on the far rightmost track, and I couldn't see much of anything. Only a few bright windows against a dark black granite backdrop, maybe some water somewhere. I sat for minutes, the train even stopped once. But the bridge's beams blocked and only glimmers of light shined through. We eventually went into a tunnel. New York was too full of itself.
