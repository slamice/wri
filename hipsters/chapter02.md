Back at the party. We were there for another 20 minutes. They went in for a bit to check it out, but I could tell the two of them were getting finicky. Jack finished his cigarette in a few minutes and, "but seriously man I'm gonna bail. I'm really sorry, but I've got this thing with Sarah tonight and it's like you know me I'm sorry." His sentence bowed, shuffled and shrugged.

"It's not a big deal, you don't have to apologize. I'll see you later though, like another night."

"Really sorry I can't right now."  And he slowly walked off waving, with Ryan bumbling and lagging behind him whispering a "me too." Matt never showed up either.

How a show usually played out is posters went up in skate shops, coffee shops, really expensive barbershops. Each of these shops had only 3 items on their menus, those sort of places. Doors at 8, starts at 9. People know it really starts at 10. Bands keep waiting for their drinks and drunks. They go on at 11 or 11:30. It ends at 4am after the fourth band, but the police break it up at 3am.

This isn't that kind of show though, we don't technically really have to wait for anyone. It's 90's Dance night and that's a guaranteed win. Everyone here was an angry teenager then wanting to dye some highlights into their memories. Now we're back. But instead we have 60's pop remakes we forgot about on the radio, and they're in vogue again. One night only until the next 90's dance party five months from now.

By now people stupided towards the door, a few already drinking, a few more warming up with headbands. Some beards were abound, a few lit up.

I flew in profusely like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened in front of crowds. Some bumped into me accidentally and intentionally. A few jeered at nothing then laughed.

The party was a pagan dance. 90's theme be damned. Someone threw up the 60's, 70's, 90's (but mostly the eighties) onto some far and not finely aged wasted teenage bodies. Everyone was clad with chababyness. The dance floor was surrounded with quotation marks. Fashion was ripe with faux-paus chic and undeniable clashing that somehow made the word "tacky" look tame. Two were dancing the robot like humans. Straight out of Wonderland were Alices in all colors of the rainbow. A ghostbuster did a violent shuffle near a spinster, backpack jigging and all.

Many weirds and beards shot each other, the digital polaroids barely drying between takes. Mouths were open, strung out on jargon, cheap beer and dance music. Some girls made a few soft-core poses, each holding a meaningless subliminal message.

I scanned through the crowds casually. The lights were dim and confused, spraying in every other direction. I recognized a few passing faces in passing.  A few more prominent and active members ignored me. I made a hard nod at one girl made tapestries. Finally Selina waded into the crowd. I caught fleeting glimpses of Selina's roommate Adrian and her periodic boyfriend. They were lost in a few ways, most prominently in dancing.

"What's up and yo?" Selina and I pounded hands and laughed. She donned light flannel and a grey cap.

"Yo yo yo. You're looking really grungy."

"I've been wearing this since this morning! How long have you been here?" Her smile was huge.

"Not that long, like half an hour. Thought I would check it out."

"Ch-check-ch-check-ch-checking it out!" She tried to yell over the bad dance style. I heard it because most of the moves around us were just people walking badly.

What was popular possibly eons ago started to play again. We danced a few jigs and tried to steal a few dance moves from our surroundings. We shuffled left and right and looked around us.

About 20 minutes later Selina's friend Adrian formed out of thin air and pulled Selina by the arm miming a smoker. I followed them outside, and the cold air hit us once again.

"Hey we've got to jam twice this week so we're ready for Saturday." Selina looked up at me as she lit up, and I fanned away wafts of marijuana.

"Ah yea ~no kidding~." she blew out and coughed a bit. "Oh did you get your papers yet?" with an earnest.

"Not yet, it's going to take a while."

"Whatever, government. THE GOVERNMENT!" She yelled. Selina was against everything government. She gauffed at capitalism and stood honestly in disbelief at the many injustices of the world mentioned to her. Her eyes would literally grow bigger if anyone mentioned grim crimes involving theft, extortion, brutalizing women or death. "Oh my god" she would usually exclaim between sips from her latte.

Adrian took a toke next to her with her boyfriend Hayden. I never really did know what to say to her friend. She worked in a coffee shop day in day out, surrounded by people who looked familiar but I didn't know. She gave Selina free coffee every time she visited with soy milk of course thanks. She coughed it up a bit, her face red. To Selina,

"How long do you wanna stay? I saw Steve inside, we could go to his house afterwards. Kind of an after party thing."

"I'm up for that, he's a good guy. Wait, Steve Flemer? Or Steve from 'No Hope?'"

"From No Hope." Adrian yelled, laughing. "Who's the other guy?"

They trailed off into a world of drama. I turned to Hayden, also slunked against the brick wall, and ask him what, exactly, was up. He said nothing in particular, which was nothing. A distinctive ambiguous shrug. Eventually he gave out that he was between jobs, working on contract as a graphic designer for a business by the waterfront. "I've been making some show posters too."

"I saw one of them I think, the kiwis with the lasers coming out of their eyes, that-"

"Hah, yea I'm particularly proud of that one."

"To Steve's!" Adrian yelled. Selina followed suit, and we slowly walked to Adrian's cyan beetle and piled in.

Inevitably, Adrian began discussing her family for a bit. People in her story were drunk, had financial problems. Selina and I echoed "Yea I know that's hard."

"I don't know what to do about my Dad. I don't know what to do. So many family issues and nothing gets resolved, you know?" She was talking strictly to Selina.

"No kidding that's hard." Selina stared out into the street. For a bit we drove in her bug silently. Hayden flipped through radio stations until he gave up. It coughed up something we didn't recognize, but we were lulled by it and the static with every turn down a street. A few cats were lying on sidewalks waiting to be petted.

"Did you hear about Darren?" Adrian said, her voice a bit less scratchy and distressed.

"Oh my god what a disaster." Hayden echoed.

 Selina woke up "No, what about him? Didn't he have a show recently?" I could see Adrian was still, her mouth straightened and formed slowly, over the next few minutes, into a frown.

 "Him and Gabe were playing a show at The Laundry Room the other day. With his band Hellen Killer? You know. Darren thought that it would be cool if he brought some lighter fluid right? It would be a great show. He dumped a bit on his guitar and lit it on fire, and continued to play as much as he could. But the space is pretty small, and the fire slowly got out of control. The whole place was wood. And while he was taking his guitar off he kicked the lighter fluid into the crowd. This girl ended up catching on fire and the paramedics came. It was 2 a.m. and everyone was panicking."

"****" I said, any expression I had before fell to the floor of the car, rolling back and forth as the car turned.

"What happened to the girl?" Selina whispered in shock.

"Well the horrible thing is she ended up in the hospital with two degree burns. Everyone is blaming them and berating Darren and Gabe any way they can. On their flyers too now. It's horrible. They visited the girl in the hospital a few times and apologized." Adrian then turned to Selina, stern, "It didn't make a difference. Also The Laundry Room is gone, it burnt down that night. No one can play there any more."

"God, that's horrible." Selina said.

"No one stops telling them they're jerks. I mean no one thinks about them. Darren feels horrible and they don't have to make him feel any worse. They probably won't play for months too, how could they?"

Adrian parked on the street and we headed quietly towards Steve's house. A fair oodle of people were already inside. The place was barely furnished, toppled in and out of itself. The living room was a mattress, love seat and a short coffee table with papers and weed. We sat down next to these stranger underneath the projector.  Steve started up some indian music. His band, Boombastic, practically stole all these rhythms and put a beat to them.

This environment sat nicely with the rest of the people hanging out there, about fifteen more or so. All friends of his roommates or friends. They passed around some sort of blunt and pills I didn't recognize. I didn't bother to take either off their hands. Steve was hard at work entertaining Adrian and Hayden. His voice fit so well in the background I couldn't distinguish it at first when he turned to me, "Why don't you smoke up?"

"I'm not so sure I'd be happy with the results."

"I don't know man sometimes it's nice to find out what those are. But that's cool." I nodded at a few more things he said muffled by the music and the crowd, then he went back to Adrian and Hayden promptly.

Looking back, I remember not wondering about Renee. I remember staring at those faces, hazy through the smoke. Words drifting in the air next to them. They were cut up by the music and popped like bubbles as they spoke. Adrian's round face looked like a laughing cloud. My memory reduces Hayden was only to his fat nose getting high.

Selina grabbed me hard by the arm and let me to a corner and we got up, and led me to a corner. Her eyes were a bit bloodshot and half closed dreamily. She smirked like a thoroughly candied child. We didn't need to shout anymore and I smiled with her.

"Is this the after party or the after after party?"

"Hmmm..." she wondered, her lips thoroughly pushed up exaggerated, "Has kind of an after-after party feel. I think we skipped one." and then her eyes opened up fully and I could see her red cornea canals, "We NEED to get a show Steve."

"WE NEED TO GET A SHOW WITH STEVE."

"He's got so many connections and he's such a nice guy."

"Adrian barely knows him though."

"We could tour Europe with them Om." and then she whispered, "we could tour..."

"How?" after realizing she was serious.

"They have a record deal. We could piggy back off of them. It would be the greatest time of your life Om."

I thought about any possible complications.

"You'll get your visa by then! It's been years! Om! Om!" she stared me in the eyes, paused. Her hands started stuffing invisible scones and butter rolls in her mouth "Om Om Om." she laughed to infinity and I joined in for a bit. It was so stupid we never got tired of it.

We drifted to other parts of the party. I leaned against the wall and watched the room unfold. It and the people in it felt shruggy and benevolent, smoking away to a low psychedelic hymn ignoring each other moderately.

I sat around for a bit more. I peer at the girls, drinking up various brown liquids. Most in black and two in camo jackets. I think they're beautiful on the outside. I take a look at the boys, rolling weed and describing their lives.

A mustashio'ed man wearing a reggae mop leaned a few feet away from me in silence. I peered over at him.

"When did you get here?" I whispered to him.

He ignored me briefly, but then breathed out without looking at me "about half an hour ago I guess. I'm getting tired already."

"Yea I know what you mean." When I really didn't.

"It's getting pretty late." He sulked, then smiled at himself profoundly.

"I've been tired before I even got here." I chuckled truthfully, but it was impossible to know if he was listening. He didn't look at me yet or ever again and left it at that. He walked away straight faced, taking his bloodshot eyes with him. I mulled that over in my head, and I only heard silence above the muttering people and the droning music.

Parties like these were brutally exhausting without something substantial to dull me. Weed was usually the norm but light drinking was another option I took up. I never overindulged, but inhaled just enough to feel like it was working. Two beers were enough for me that night.

So I left Selina at the party and I walked home. My steps were slow and my direction was mostly aimless. I counted the buildings I passed and the people who stood outside the few clubs that remained open. I passed a native indian prostitute who puffed up her boobs into the hole of her v-neck. I passed by the many overnight parked cars. A couple, if they were that legitimately, startled me with their discreet argument as I passed by a random car.

I was sketched out, my hands were in my pockets, my right gripping my keys and flipping through them.



Ch1. We next see his personal life. He's at a dance party with his "friends". He hates the atmosphere but goes anyway. His "friends" ditch him but he stays, holding out. We learn about the hipster atmosphere. His other friend takes him to a party with a possible proposition to get out of the city. He's ambivalent in general but excited and decides to aim for it.























































Ch2. This sets the scene for who his coworkers are, who his gf is, who he is. The cat is a siren. We learn he is tired of his office life, working like a broken machine.




My body fought me and woke up. Ten, twenty or thirty minutes more of sleep didn't seem to matter to it anymore. It humiliated me but I whined back. I didn't want to go to work. I didn't want to work. Was I just bad at it or did I hate my job? I wasn't sure.

There were no curtains on my windows yet, for months, but I somehow slept late into a late morning with the sun pawing at my face. That day I woke up still in a bizarre dream while Renee dozed next to me in a really thick sleep deep in a gutter. The bed springs squirmed, and as I got up slowly, they bit back audibly. I slipped off the bed, grabbing my jeans from the floor and a shirt from the rack. Renee's cat Chibi laid on a pile of our clothes looking up at me, tired and bloated. It watched me wander around the room. With its' eyes it asked me, "why are you awake, that's a pitiful thing to be."

Anything eaten too early in the morning I gagged on. Apples, oranges, toast. The only thing that stayed down were latte's. 

The sun poked me and the morning met my gaze. It glared a mean hello. The day was bright and cheery and yet profoundly and beautifully mundane. The water pressure in the shower was still way too hard. It sprayed me like an elephant in a zoo, the drops pelted in a rage. My button up was too big for me, like someone threw a blanket on a chair and it just sat there. I wore it anyway.

Everyday I shaved and tapped my razor handle against my hand so it would vomit out the hair. I used to tap the sink, but Renee heard it in her dreams. It was far too loud and she hated waking up in the morning to it, tiny hair spraying against the sink so early. "No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a huge razor to the floor.

The room defined askew. The bag of my socks were under random bits of clothes and books. It was pretty late but the only way to find anything was to start cleaning. Around laid trash bags of clothes and boxes unopened, half opened, opened for business, closed, etc and etc. A thin coat of stuff covered the floor and I tip toed over it. Our apartment was above a shifty limousine dispatch, neighboring a recycling office.

After shifting the couch I found a pair of socks. Renee moaned in her sleep softly but the wake of it was loud enough. I still heard it as I shut the door quietly behind me.

I don't need to but will mention the owners' of the place were dodgy themselves. Double dodgy. Two cousins from rich Indian families bought this building and then started the limo dispatch on the first floor a century back. One never came to the office once office. His pictures were all over it though with the latest limousine models. The other, simply nicknamed Raf, was shackled under house arrest for arranging prostitute rides for political clients amonth into our lease. I found that out in a newspaper one day, on the coffee table in my office. The print read Raf talked behind high caliber clients' backs. He called the prime minister 'little dictator' while dispatching a driver and an unclassy broad. Oh and he was our landlord.

We arranged a deal with Raf that we'd pay to live in his illegally zoned apartment for nothing more than rent and to shut up.

Outside, our neighboring recycling station stood tall and busy. People were fast at work, trucks driving in and out recycled whatnots, laughing loudly at each other just because. The bottles, cans, tins, broken glass, milk jugs were sorted, tossed and recombined with each other. I wasn't clear exactly what they did with the recycling besides pack it in clear plastic bags. You could plainly see their wealth of trash. One day it'll be useful, but for now it's just for show.

Past the few warehouses, the territorial crows buzzed around one corner, some above my head. One in particular swooped down on me daily, nearly scathing my hair. So territorial. I ignored it completely though, it really wasn't worth it. The city was already awake and in full motion. Cars went places. The coffee shop lines were long and the trains were packed.

The sea of people ebbed and flowed to the train and I swam with them. I wondered about these strangers, and how strange they were. I wondered for a few moments where she went home, who he wanted to be, who are these people's parents. Where do they think they're going and where are they actually going.

On the train each person tried to sneak a silent look at the other. A cough gurgled up from somewhere buried in the crowd. Off the train, I hobbled up the the station stairs.

"Michael good morning!" Michael just came out of the building and placed himself in a nook. He towered over the street, passing walkers and me.

"Isn't it too early to smoke?"

"Morning Om. It's not too early. -You're - not too early," he smiled.

"Yea well I wasn't really looking forward to today." I said casually, trying to mimic him, "This project never ends Michael."

"You've got to bear with it. We could say we fixed a whole state's license system by the end of this. It's a long haul."

People rushed across the intersection, most in suits and black skirts. The sky cleared a bit and shed some light on the dank dirty sidewalk.

I sputtered out, "But, today's gonna be hectic and quiet. Like a goldfish dying. I don't really see an end to any of this."

"Like a goldfish dying?"

"I don't know, nothing. It's a long story."

"How long?" He coughed out.

"Well, Actually..." I paused. "it's a short or long story depending on how you tell it."

He chuckled a bit. He waved me in a see you later. The slight wet heat mugged me one last time before the air conditioner gushed in my face.

It was sort of a race. I could never wake up early enough to get to work on time. The walls of the office were painted off hue primary colors. Shy bold statements. As I laid on my desk, the usual suspects were already there programming. The lazy hellos and good mornings were drilled out slowly like a list.

 Their clothes were a bit dapper in a casual way. Lucius wore a tight button up with a wrinkled collar. Tyler distinctively cared less about his ratty dress shirt than his rattier combed hair. The only chatter in every department was the computer keyboards whispering their damnedest. Every so often a private phone call came to life in a room buried in a corner somewhere.

I stared a bit at my coworkers but not long enough to not draw attention to myself. People engaged their whole hearts, a bit at a time, monotonously trying to make their work come alive. They pushed pixel after pixel and then a few more, some faster than others. I could see it in their glazed eyes. Everyday we talked over problems. Made micro adjustments. We took ten of them and tore them up all at once. Everyone was terribly excited over these changes. We all thought, these problems existed to be solved. Driver license systems needed to be overhauled, redone. Pictures needed cropping. Reports needed to be created. Claims needed to be claimed. How would we graph it, how could we get more information out of them?

Mik walked in the room, "Well good morning!" it came out like a question, his dutch accent thick and pronounced. I nodded and smiled back at him a good morning. Mik was a product manager committed to creating the most relaxed environment possible. The day proceeded and time was butchered into planning, lunch and typing. Oh, and clicking. We compiled lists of items and descriptions of them. We drew what they could look like out and threw most of them away.

Lunch came and left. Four in the afternoon clocked in and left shortly after. I couldn't tell but felt it, felt how time was lucky like that. Literally leaving any time it wanted.

Midday our business analyst Ryan sifted through photos. "There is no difference," Ryan interrupted no one, "from hipsters and the homeless. It's really really hard to tell the difference." Tom chuckled and relaxed into a smile.

Ryan peered over at me. "Do you know the difference?"

"I think homeless people have more fashion sense I guess?" Tom muttered smiling.

But I intentionally ignored them and zoned out. I zoned out a few times daily. To what I can't remember. To random things. It's kind of the definition as well, designed to forget.

You have to understand. I tried to build things so they could speak to me. The screen should have screamed something intelligible instead of staring back at me, blandly holding up the garbage boxes and text I drew on it. Sometimes deep down I want to just let things be. There are enough natural rules already.

I was in the hallway, between snacks and lack of snacks, when Mik approached me. "Hey Man!" he wore cowboy boots that day, in defiance to the more fashionable of the managers sporting their dusty three peice suits. His glasses were thin but still  made his nose look obtruse like it was poking you and the conversation you had with him. "Haven't talked to you in a while."

"Nothing really to talk about."

"You sure?" He asked, intentionally changing his face to puzzled, not holding back that it was a fake natural look.

"Yea I'm pretty sure." I wasn't sure what I was supposed to feign. Regret, fatigue, accomplishment maybe. He still stood there though, expecting me to excuse as it grew more awkward.

"You'll let me know right? Tell me when you feel comfortable. If it's something or nothing. Did you get your visa?"

"Not yet, no."

"Let me know when you get it. There's details and all that to resolve. We don't you to need us to continue to support you forever." And he actually winked.

"Of course not I wouldn't want th-"

"Unless you wanted to continue to work here." He paused but not long enough for it to be a legitimate, and then laughed at his remark and sidled off as just kidding as he headed to his office, one of the few of us who had an office.

I dug into work almost as seriously as I dug into my chips. It didn't behave and needed wrangling.









At six or so everyone began shaking their things, feeling a bit uneasy. Someone ruffled their coat onto themselves, and then pretended to realize it was time to go.

I packed my things and left. Out the door, into the street, on the crowded train. Past them, past the burden that beckoned me to come back again tomorrow but giving it a nod.

The recycling shop was closed, thousands of bottles and cans snug, sleeping and snoozing in their clear bags. I shut my apartment door, the cat whined and whined inside. No purring whatsoever. You could the  low siren rising, like what you'd hear in a foreign country before the silence, before the bombing.

If Renee was awake, it was impossible to tell. Her eye lids were practically shut. Sitting in bed, topless, her posture and nudity fit a greek aristocratic she-lump. What played in front of her was the most unimaginable imaginable television. Horror movies with identical endings, relationship finales foreshadowing later romps. The reality Romcoms poured from her computer like an open facet, spilling and staining the room, ruining the wallpaper. Misunderstood nerds loving curly haired attitude women. One dimensional machos winning over dysfunctional girls only alive to mall and bawl. One man obsessed with "mancaves", girls caked with makeup running down their angry sad faces. ((There were a few plots where they only ate together and incested incestually off each other.))

"How was your day, Om? What did you do?" a seedless grape slid into Renee's mouth.

"Things happened that were less than nothing today." I murmured.

"Can you turn on the washing machine again? I forgot to put the clothes in the dryer. Wash them again so they don't get moldy."

"Did you happen to check the mail?" I perked my ears up a bit.

"No, I had to hurry to work today and didn't have time. I didn't feel like waiting for them, seems busy now too." Her eyes were still glued to the screen, the cat yawned for attention.

"I'm trying to be patient I swear..." flipping through my vinyl and wondered which record would numb effectively. Most were hygenicized, trapped in clear plastic. The 70's, 80's, 90's underground flip by. Nothing was jarring enough to procrastinate to. I shed so many tears over those new wave, no wave, ho wave genres and perhaps they dulled me. Good or bad goosebumps with every listen. Finally I settled on something with a really light voice  to some ambient piano, and started up dinner.

The kitchen was only a tiny mess compared to the living room. Dishes weren't piled high enough to call it a disaster.
Renee gave me a juicer from the 70's, incredibly powerful and just as hard to clean. Fruit flies laid back on lawn chairs on it, sunglasses and a bit of smoothie in their tiny glasses. Occassionally they flew up a bit and waggled around looking for another spot. 

I don't remember what I cooked that night, but I do remember it was bland. I didn't let her cook anyway. She burnt curry once and that was her introduction and goodbye to the kitchen. So I made the food and most of the things I made were courtesy of a diet Renee had dedicated herself to; she wasn't allowed anything fermented, with spice, with meat, ground or with dairy. "Sacrifice, I've been doing it my whole life." She said vigilantly and proud. "Everyone has to write their own story Om. I'm writing my own story, you're in it too." By now I was used to these broad statements. They were one of the reasons I loved her, the insistence and necessity she gave her language. The way she used them to feel independent and smart. Salt was completely out of the question and answer, so I took her dietary challenge as an excuse to make something creative. My mouth took it as a challenge to taste plenty of non-flavors.

Outside stood the vacant parking lots and warehouses, limos occasionally drive to and fro. The window made a frame to the distant city and the reddening horizon. The New York sun wasn't at all like in Lebanon. Somehow it felt bigger there, pulsing with blood and vigor as it slid down the sky. Here the smog painted it smudgy, the tips of buildings poking at it.

A heard the Chinese lady selling clothes, yelling in the distance "sock sock underwear tanktop!"

After dinner and before I slept I sighed downstairs, but they said nothing came that day. There was no mail.
