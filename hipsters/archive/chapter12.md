Ch12. Renee moves out. Dad calls and says the news. The band opportunity breaks down.

A month didn't fly by. I felt it wriggling in my gut everyday. It does sound worse than it was. It was just uncomfortable. There were no fights, barely any orders. Some of the people we knew patted me on the back, others simply apologized and walked away. But mostly no one said anything, an odd missed opportunity to entertain themselves with drama.

All her stuff in boxes, all her drawings starting when she was 2 years old, her entire highschool and middle school courses and year books, copied handwriting and shorthand classes, classwork, doodles, 

We sat outside and the second moving van that day cancelled for a third time. This gave us enough time to pack everything into boxes though. Renee sat on one of them and we waited for her iouesca ceremony leader now. He promised to take some of the tables and chairs off our hands. I realized that the apartment was truly bare. She took all the dishes, the furniture, the bookshelf, most of the records, etc.



Two movers we found through friends cancelled. My guess was they were too hungover after a long night of drunken partying and self destruction. All Renee's boxes lined the sidewalk for hours until finally her shaman took some pity and arrived in his van. We said hi and he looked at me unsure what to say or do. I assured him the boxes needed to go in the van, relocated to her old freinds place to live in a half room. A very poor excuse of a room.

I kind of wanted the cat. But it was the type of cat where one day it would lie on you and you'd pet it, and unexpectedly it would bite your hand maliciously and evaporate under the bed. Kind of like every cat. That's why I only kind of wanted it. In the end though I bought very organic food and cat tree to spite Renee. She was a loser who couldn't provide for herself let alone a cat. She lost. I won.

I watched her lose some more later that day. Because just before lunch I watched her van leave. (She walked out of the story she was never a part of.)


The apartment was ridiculously empty. Laughably spacious and bleak. There was only a strewn mess of sheets, my clothes piled in a corner, and a few spice bottles ((put something besides "bottles")). I danced in the empty space and put on a record to celebrate. Something melodramatic, simple symphonic with post-folk melodies with an amatuer voice. With feeling. I felt.

The winter cold came in and my hands felt chapped and whithered. I itched them constantly because of how dry they were, and the skin crept into corners and bled open small cuts. They began to grow red and chapped. No amount of lotion that I barely put on them could solve that problem. They required maintenance I wasn't ready to give them and I decided I didn't care as much and I thought they'd probably heal in summer anyway. The dead white skin on top of them fell off when I itched my hands like cheese from a shaver. Was it because when I walked I kept them in my pockets, or that they need to be exposed even for a bit while typing at work? They were incredibly idle, which was both the parodox and regretably probably the reason. The skin between my fingers shafed and I finally taped a few bandaids on them so I didn't feel the pain whenever I bent my fingers and a woulnd very annoyingly opened. ((perhaps parallel with relationship with Renee. Old cuts don't heal but these will heal. The wounds are 'annoying' and not that painful. 1000 tiny cuts could kill someone, 10 cuts are just annoying))

Her truck was long gone and I suprised myself by not feeling happy or empty. So I went back in and checked the mail again and it was junk. One letter was twenty dollars off a two hundred dollar thing. The other was just a thing. Both horrible deals I would never consider entertaining. Not in my home.

The first thing I did when I went back into the house was throw away the juicer from the 70's. The fruit flies on it were surely disappointed but the vibrant orange with the tough berry stains on it in the green garbage pail... It was so beautiful I feighned tears of mirth. The colors matched so well together, and the few flies on it jumped when I threw the heavy thing in. 





I sat on the floor and thought of my prospects. Maybe I wouldn't renew the lease. I fantasized the tour in my head and we went city to city wavering. Long road trips with new music and very stupid jokes. The van would break down towards the end and we'd sit by the side of the road discussing our problems and depressions. And after that under the dark sky with Selina asleep in shotgun under the desert stars etcetera and all that. I'd stop the car, for a few moments, and I'd cry.

You know what's in that letter? After the patience and the sustained life around it. The pressure has been building up in it and I imagine if I open it it would just explode, into a mess I'd bathe in lazily and cleanup with the sweet sounds of music ejecting itself off the walls, off the clouds. 








A late lunch couldn't possibly disappoint. Selina was there already. So I headed out.
