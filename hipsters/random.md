I wondered if there were any lessons we could have learned from the schools we dropped out of, skipped, floated through... No one really paid any attention.

Bored as fuck. I've seen these bands. One twice, one thrice, one I haven't seen but I'll probably be disappointed.

People stupided towards the door, a few already drinking, a few more warming up with headbands getting ready. Beards abound, a few lit up.

I flew in profusely inside like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened.

Fucking chain smokers. Chain smoking. Fucking shameless, lazy, passive aggressive moronic. A hipster is an excuse for coffee and a laptop, reading softcore porn, making shitty art. A fuck it and a shoulder shrug. Greasy spoon breakfasts. $25 dollars for coffees all day but is always poor.

Polka dotted apron skirt, grey shirt white collar. Two ear piercings per ear. White socks black shoes. Short short hair. Long eye lashes. She was Spanish. (still a hipster)

Subway trains and hipsters

TOKYO: around specific stations, living near there, they disappear into suits in the morning.

NYC: decorating a dilapidated environment. Not a compliment but a christening on the style and cleanliness of the train.

Story:

Issam is between two worlds. A fantasy yuppie lifestyle and a hipster dumpster dream. In a world of misfits, strange characters and lazy people, he brushes shoulders with them as he passes, leading to his ultimate conclusion of where he belongs.

It begins with him facing off his fears of doubt and loneliness. He works in an office but is still detached from the environment. He has friends from university but they fit in with the rest of the drunken hipster
miscreants, all dating each other. He goes to concerts, plays in concerts, goes to crappy breakfast places. Eventually it all breaks down. He

Ryan squabed the bottle from the table and took a bit of a swig. Selina took a picture with the dead body, peace signs abound.

Psycho roommates (hipster? Psycho?), have to move out

I came home with Renee smirking, half joshing.


The monotony of days blended together at that point. Meeting at the coffee

I invited them, at least I initiated a passive invite. When two worlds cross; the drunks with the skids, the attention whores with genuine whores. I stir these pots but there's no cook in sight, and I'll be damned if I have to taste a soup that needs fenugreek.

The boxes toppled down on me like lead bricks, paralyzingly my legs and torso.

If you have seen one greasy spoon then you get the general idea. But really, you haven't seen them all. There are varying degrees of greasiness following each other.

Bons off broadway, for example, is legendary with high school students and high school student imitators. It is amazing what people will eat. Breakfast is all day, so realistically people are in there around 11 or noon.

While waiting for food you may:
1. Talk about drunken things that have happened the night before
2. Stack creamers in a pyramid shape
3. Shake a creamer until it turns into butter, which takes the entire breakfast.
4. Writher in disgust as the waiter give you a jug of water, and at the bottom is one of his punk bracelet spikes.

The food is two eggs swimming in oil, with fried frozen hash browns. That experience is $2.99... So about $3.15 with tax.

Of course the real deal is the greasy spoon that is closest when you wake up. The place must be owned by Canadians to make it authentically awful, and as white as the toast you eat there as possible.

We went there, and of course it was crowded because everyone woke up at 11am.

Renee drank all kinds of liqueurs, plant ointments, liver extracts, and anything that wasn't yet expired with the Aryuvedic sticker she applied herself. I experimented with them, trying 300 grams of turmeric in water daily. I tried some and it was liquid clay.
