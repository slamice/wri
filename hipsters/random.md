I wondered if there were any lessons we could have learned from the schools we dropped out of, skipped, floated through... No one really paid any attention.

Talk about anju's hatecore music




Bored as fuck. I've seen these bands. One twice, one thrice, one I haven't seen but I'll probably be disappointed.

People stupided towards the door, a few already drinking, a few more warming up with headbands getting ready. Beards abound, a few lit up.

I flew in profusely inside like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened.

----------

Fucking chain smokers. Chain smoking. Fucking shameless, lazy, passive aggressive moronic. A hipster is an excuse for coffee and a laptop, reading softcore porn, making shitty art. A fuck it and a shoulder shrug. Greasy spoon breakfasts. $25 dollars for coffees all day but is always poor.

Waist high jeans, black boots. White wife beater.

Polka dotted apron skirt, grey shirt white collar. Two ear piercings per ear. White socks black shoes. Short short hair. Long eye lashes. She was Spanish. (still a hipster)

I don't remember too much about myself, honestly. It didn't seems like a big deal at the time to memorize anything about me.

Subway trains and hipsters

TOKYO: around specific stations, living near there, they disappear into suits in the morning.

NYC: decorating a dilapidated environment. Not a compliment but a christening on the style and cleanliness of the train.

Story:

Om is between two worlds. A fantasy yuppie lifestyle and a hipster dumpster dream. In a world of misfits, strange characters and lazy people, he brushes shoulders with them as he passes, leading to his ultimate conclusion of where he belongs.

It begins with him facing off his fears of doubt and loneliness. He works in an office but is still detached from the environment. He has friends from university but they fit in with the rest of the drunken hipster
miscreants, all dating each other. He goes to concerts, plays in concerts, goes to crappy breakfast places. Eventually it all breaks down. He

Psycho roommates (hipster? Psycho?), have to move out

I came home with Renee smirking, half joshing.


The monotony of days blended together at that point. Meeting at the coffee





---

I invited them, at least I initiated a passive invite. When two worlds cross; the drunks with the skids, the attention whores with genuine whores. I stir these pots but there's no cook in sight, and I'll be damned if I have to taste a soup that needs fenugreek.

The boxes toppled down on me like lead bricks, paralyzingly my legs and torso.

If you have seen one greasy spoon then you get the general idea. But really, you haven't seen them all. There are varying degrees of greasiness following each other.

Bons off broadway, for example, is legendary with high school students and high school student imitators. It is amazing what people will eat. Breakfast is all day, so realistically people are in there around 11 or noon.

While waiting for food you may:
1. Talk about drunken things that have happened the night before
2. Stack creamers in a pyramid shape
3. Shake a creamer until it turns into butter, which takes the entire breakfast.
4. Writher in disgust as the waiter give you a jug of water, and at the bottom is one of his punk bracelet spikes.

The food is two eggs swimming in oil, with fried frozen hash browns. That experience is $2.99... So about $3.15 with tax.

Of course the real deal is the greasy spoon that is closest when you wake up. The place must be owned by Canadians to make it authentically awful, and as white as the toast you eat there as possible.

We went there, and of course it was crowded because everyone woke up at 11am.

Renee drank all kinds of liqueurs, plant ointments, liver extracts, and anything that wasn't yet expired with the Aryuvedic sticker she applied herself. I experimented with them, trying 300 grams of turmeric in water daily. I tried some and it was liquid clay.

The offenders sat around the room offending.

Renee gave me a juicer from the 70's, incredibly powerful and just as hard to clean. Fruit flies laid back on lawn chairs on it, sunglasses and a bit of smoothie in their tiny glasses. Occassionally they flew up a bit and waggled around looking for another spot.

I practically begged her to come with me. In fact I did beg her, to walk down the street to the train statiion because it had a photo booth. Between bouts of mono and her rash she finally agreed one night to the 20 minute venture.

"That's the most interesting Jicama I've seen..."

Main character:



What he wants: to fit in



How to get it: hang out with friends, coworkers, until he finds something



Problem: he's disgusted with everyone, tries to change them



Renee:

I scrolled through a database of thousands of people, each with a name, birthday and an insincere smile waiting to be boxed again and printed.

The room swirled like a brick thrown through a window. There were voices, some scowling, some howling. Someone tried jowling their words in a effort to make them clearer. Someone whispered in my ear, "YEAAAAH!"



I thought a weight would be lifted. I thought we'd take it all in stride, catapulting ourselves to stardom. I thought we'd all be higher, together even, rimbaulding around... Our gullets wet and our minds thoroughly relaxed, waning in and out of pleasure commas. I thought the more I sunk the more I'd be in the thick of it.



But really, I didn't and couldn't think of anything at that point. As soon as I had an idea it kicked me in the face. I felt it.



Was there anything to understand?


What are cruises to people anyway?


I was drunk.

The letter fell to the ground, and I kind of lost it.

Bored as fuck. I've seen these bands. One twice, one thrice, one I haven't seen but I'll probably be disappointed.


 Venues were getting sparse and landlords were losing their temper for art. Everyone was slowly trying to humiliate them out of town. They sipped their beers and couldn't quite take their tone. Inside the music sped up to a dance rhythm.

The letter in my back pocket was slowly devolving into a sweaty pulp swimming in my pocket. It still read that it was private, and still declared it was from the government.

It grew a bit colder, and I stepped back into the bar.

3 things happen with his life:

His band
His job
His personal life with his gf


The point of the book is about utterly giving up. He hates his job, begins to hate his friends, and hates the burden he has towards his gf. The only two people he likes are Selina and his mom.



It's about the descent from despair. About cornering yourself, and the consequences.








































Things riddle down to the wire.

"You're not going to drink the coffee?"

"Coffee gives me a headache. I can only drink it with other stuff in it."

"Why did you get it then?"

I put the mug up to my cheek "I got it for warmth." I said with a shy sad smile.

"It keeps you warm?" She said smiggling. (A Smile giggle)

"Yea. It keeps me warm."

"Why not tea then?"

"Somehow, I thought coffee was thicker... So it would be warmer."

Humble bragging



-------



The quick jerk shrug and violent heavy moping nearly cut me.



-----

















The working passively pushed on the turnstiles. And they never pushed back. And the next day and the next. They came back around, sometimes feeling heavier.



The train lurched forward. It trudged against the tracks, stuttering between stations. People slumped and grumped in small huffs. The readers stood, hovering over their books with one bead adorned hand in the air holding the rail. The phonies rubbed and smudged their mobiles into a fine oily fingerprint mess. The rest sat or stood vacantly waiting.

I am the shit.

(He sucks or is he great?)

Michael faces me one Monday morning.  The facing face is torn up into a heavy smile. It's tired and it hides behind itself with a fake drowsy sickness. The combination is familiar yet bizarre.



He asked me, "what?"



I said, "nothing."



He asked me "what do you see?" And he touched it, trying to pull off a stray hair.



I saw a taboo, so I said nothing and shrugged perfectly. I'd become a professional shrugger, might as well abuse the talent.
