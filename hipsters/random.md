Om is looking for something beautiful. He knows its beyond the city, beyond his job, beyond the scene.



Protagonist:
Om

Antagonists:

Band - Self indulgent
Father - Selfish 
Adrian - Doesn't like him intruding on scene, wants to be master of her domain, a frenemy. Fine to be friends with her.
Renee - Selfish with her own demands
Dock and Andrew - Jealous and takes it out on him phsycologically
Co-workers - Think lowly of him because he's not one of them.
Society - Pressures from society to do work



Challenge him by saying what he wants doesnt exist.

Eventually he gets sick of all of them. He'll go on tour by themselves if he has to, just to live it, live the life he wants for serenity.

Until he gets pulled back by his father.




The ultimate conclusion wasn't to create something beautiful. The ultimate goal was to fit in.









(Dance) Party1 ch1 
(get ready for work) Home1 ch2
(Work sucks) Work1 ch2

(coffee with selina) Party2 ch3
(Talk with Michael) Work2 ch3

(Boat + party with girl) Party3 ch4

() Party4 ch5
Home4 ch7



Point is to show the misguided life of hipsters
-- Dance Party
-- Drug house
-- Renee's friends' house
-- Concert
-- Dock's anger

Om is a hipster but doesn't want to be
-- Hangs out with hipsters
-- is very indifferent about his life
-- cares about small minute things
-- Very into no responsibility, avoiding it
-- coffee conversation with Selina

Doesn't know how to break free when the alternaive he hates
-- Office job
-- Michael's reaction to work he agrees with but doesn't feel compelled to do it
-- "Hates" money but actually like it to waste it

So he aimlessly floats between them, experiments mildly with cheating and ignoring work
-- Kisses girl from Boat Party
-- Calling in sick when he isn't, wanders aimlessly

He starts to put things into perspective
-- Itchy hands, they feel "idle"
-- All the people he knows are living off in "shelter"s or "dumps"

His dream is crushed but he thinks maybe he has a shot at something
-- Band member rejects him
-- His laziness and indifference risks his job, puts him behind
-- Renee turns out to be not a great fit for his lifestyle (she's a hipster)

Until he feels compelled to throw it all away because of his family issues.
-- Dad leaves Mom
-- Letter from immigration never arrives





















----------------------------

The city that never sleeps. But everyone is tired.



Disasters:

failing relationship
Failing job
Failing family
Failing passion (band)

---------

The amount of sushi I ate with cottage cheese was a quesy distaste.

No, it wasn't very appetizing.

If you look down you only see the ground, but if you look higher you see the sky and the clouds.

Charlatan out a death march























He picked the plaque out of his teeth

----------------

I don't remember how many times I made a walk like that.


---------




I wondered if there were any lessons we could have learned from the schools we dropped out of, skipped, floated through... No one really paid any attention.
-Life is a series of mistakes and you grade yourself at the end. Of course we were too immersed in the brutality.-

Agnostic tattoo parlour

"I like to control my life with random coincidences"

Talk about anju's hatecore music




Bored as fuck. I've seen these bands. One twice, one thrice, one I haven't seen but I'll probably be disappointed.

People stupided towards the door, a few already drinking, a few more warming up with headbands getting ready. Beards abound, a few lit up.

I flew in profusely inside like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened.

----------

Fucking chain smokers. Chain smoking. Fucking shameless, lazy, passive aggressive moronic. A hipster is an excuse for coffee and a laptop, reading softcore porn, making shitty art. A fuck it and a shoulder shrug. Greasy spoon breakfasts. $25 dollars for coffees all day but is always poor.


Mistaking heather for a hooker on main street

-----------

Waist high jeans, black boots. White wife beater.

Polka dotted apron skirt, grey shirt white collar. Two ear piercings per ear. White socks black shoes. Short short hair. Long eye lashes. She was Spanish. (still a hipster)


-----------

I don't remember too much about myself, honestly. It didn't seems like a big deal at the time to memorize anything about me.

Subway trains and hipsters

TOKYO: around specific stations, living near there, they disappear into suits in the morning.

NYC: decorating a dilapidated environment. Not a compliment but a christening on the style and cleanliness of the train.

Story:

Om is between two worlds. A fantasy yuppie lifestyle and a hipster dumpster dream. In a world of misfits, strange characters and lazy people, he brushes shoulders with them as he passes, leading to his ultimate conclusion of where he belongs.

It begins with him facing off his fears of doubt and loneliness. He works in an office but is still detached from the environment. He has friends from university but they fit in with the rest of the drunken hipster
miscreants, all dating each other. He goes to concerts, plays in concerts, goes to crappy breakfast places. Eventually it all breaks down. He

"I have no idea how you feel, but (the feeling) is mutual."

Ryan squabed the bottle from the table and took a bit of a swig. Selina took a picture with the dead body, peace signs abound.


------------------

Psycho roommates (hipster? Psycho?), have to move out

I came home with Renee smirking, half joshing.


The monotony of days blended together at that point. Meeting at the coffee


It must be all kinds of confusion.



---

I invited them, at least I initiated a passive invite. When two worlds cross; the drunks with the skids, the attention whores with genuine whores. I stir these pots but there's no cook in sight, and I'll be damned if I have to taste a soup that needs fenugreek.


----

"I want to cover my rift" (area between stomach and boobs)

-----


"This city never sleeps but everyone is tired"


"At all hours everyday, the world is here. It's got everything you want but nothing you need."

--------

Renee drank all kinds of liqueurs, plant ointments, liver extracts, and anything that wasn't yet expired with the Aryuvedic sticker she applied herself. I experimented with them, trying 300 grams of turmeric in water daily. I tried some and it was liquid clay.

---------


The offenders sat around the room offending.


--------

I practically begged her to come with me. In fact I did beg her, to walk down the street to the train statiion because it had a photo booth. Between bouts of mono and her rash she finally agreed one night to the 20 minute venture.


-------

Someone is wearing a Jewish smiley face Yamica :)

"That's the most interesting Jicama I've seen..."

"You mean Yamica?"

"Yea whatever one of those."

Main character:



What he wants: to fit in



How to get it: hang out with friends, coworkers, until he finds something



Problem: he's disgusted with everyone, tries to change them



Renee:



What she wants:













I scrolled through a database of thousands of people, each with a name, birthday and an insincere smile waiting to be boxed again and printed.




-------------





The room swirled like a brick thrown through a window. There were voices, some scowling, some howling. Someone tried jowling their words in a effort to make them clearer. Someone whispered in my ear, "YEAAAAH!"



I thought a weight would be lifted. I thought we'd take it all in stride, catapulting ourselves to stardom. I thought we'd all be higher, together even, rimbaulding around... Our gullets wet and our minds thoroughly relaxed, waning in and out of pleasure commas. I thought the more I sunk the more I'd be in the thick of it.



But really, I didn't and couldn't think of anything at that point. As soon as I had an idea it kicked me in the face. I felt it.



Was there anything to understand?


What are cruises to people anyway?


I was drunk.

Iceland

The letter fell to the ground, and I kind of lost it.

Bored as fuck. I've seen these bands. One twice, one thrice, one I haven't seen but I'll probably be disappointed.


==================

 Venues were getting sparse and landlords were losing their temper for art. Everyone was slowly trying to humiliate them out of town. They sipped their beers and couldn't quite take their tone. Inside the music sped up to a dance rhythm.

The letter in my back pocket was slowly devolving into a sweaty pulp swimming in my pocket. It still read that it was private, and still declared it was from the government.

It grew a bit colder, and I stepped back into the bar.

3 things happen with his life:

His band
His job
His personal life with his gf


The point of the book is about utterly giving up. He hates his job, begins to hate his friends, and hates the burden he has towards his gf. The only two people he likes are Selina and his mom.



It's about the descent from despair. About cornering yourself, and the consequences.


---------------


I tried to avoid thinking about what I needed to do. I was only good at not doing it.


--------

Things riddle down to the wire.

--------

"Here you can lose yourself like keys."


--------

Humble bragging

-------

The quick jerk shrug and violent heavy moping nearly cut me.

-----

















The working passively pushed on the turnstiles. And they never pushed back. And the next day and the next. They came back around, sometimes feeling heavier.



The train lurched forward. It trudged against the tracks, stuttering between stations. People slumped and grumped in small huffs. The readers stood, hovering over their books with one bead adorned hand in the air holding the rail. The phonies rubbed and smudged their mobiles into a fine oily fingerprint mess. The rest sat or stood vacantly waiting.



----------

I am the shit.

((He sucks or is he great?))

----------


Michael faces me one Monday morning.  The facing face is torn up into a heavy smile. It's tired and it hides behind itself with a fake drowsy sickness. The combination is familiar yet bizarre.



He asked me, "what?"



I said, "nothing."



He asked me "what do you see?" And he touched it, trying to pull off a stray hair.



I saw a taboo, so I said nothing and shrugged perfectly. I'd become a professional shrugger, might as well abuse the talent.

The stars look insane
The stars are insane

I met them at the bar. The duo from Agnostic Tattoo were playing that night, along with Almost Dead Flamingos and No Razors. I sat with them, distraught but far away. A heavy feeling lay in my stomach. I wasn't sure if I was relieved or exhausted. This feeling inhibited me, wanting to throw things until I was tired, and then afterwards throw more things.


Most of the night wasn't a blur, surprisingly. Lying on the floor, crying was an issue.

------------------


I know a pleasant lady who mowes her lawn, tries to care for it. While the inmates from the hospital just down the street insults her and she insults them. 



--------------------

Whatever Tattoo


--------------------


I walked so much my shoes ate into my socks and tehn my feet, and gave me blisters. And then wheI lied down, I'd get bed sores. What was my body telling me. ((study?))



---------------------

Even the priests and monks come down to beg, you fuckhead

I wish this wall could hug me. But then it wouldn't be a wall.















-----------------

















That day I stared into Renee's eyes, and her into mine. I wasn't sure what I saw, or was supposed to see. They were like any others, and it wasn't like I could stare into eyes that long anyway. I guess it was a boon,r eally. When you can stare and no one is offended, or aggravated, or aggitated or uncomfortable. I imagine it used to be that everyone was allowed to stare into the other's eyes until they realized they loved them, meant something to them or weren't dead yet. I stared into Renee's eyes and I watched my fisheyed reflection watching back at me. One thing I didn't expect was to find myself in there, especially since people usually move too much to notice that.
