"They live down the street... We should at least stop by to visit them. It's been four months?"

"Five months. I don't know why I'm supposed to see him."

"Because he's still my friend-" stammering.

"Your boyfriend used to beat you." He said sharply, "I don't understand why you'd want anything to do with him."

"Yea but that's old ages ago. I mean he used to get really mad but he's getting in a better place. He's moving to a BETTER PLACE in his life. Can't you see that?"

They walked underneath the window and Renee yelled for Andrew. From the second floor Jack's sleepy voice yelled "Yeah he's here. Come up!". Squirrely Sarah came down to open the door, her hair a bushel and her front teeth just slightly bucked.

The offenders sat around the room offending. Her ex's apartment was a desolate. It was a single huge room he lived in with Jack and Doc. Each of the three bedrooms were quarantined off with shower curtains. The ceiling was low but anyone taller than 6 feet could could only standup right in the very middle of the apartment. Under the only window, the skylight.

It was a bit hard to imagine the place designed for anything but a mess. Littered on the floor were Doc's coffee and cappuccino cups, paints, beer bottles, cigarette trays complete with ash, nails and chipped wood.  The lighting, as with all of the lighting within the industrial area, was a depressing florescent. There was barely a kitchen thrown off to the side. Someone tossed a lopsided fridge in a corner. A cutting board sat on the counter with a cleaver sticking straight up out of it. "For cutting cheese," Sarah whispered when she caught me staring at it.

There was art(?). Jack's portraits lined the walls. A dessert with a naked woman standing by a cactus, a mesh of naked women spewing out of a drain. A pair of boobs floating in the sky. Different chairs were painted, one had a tv glued to its seat with a portrait of a seagull. These things came to Jack casually, painted with pastels and cigarette smoke. "Which one do you like?" Jack rubbed his nose.

"Where do your ideas come from?" I asked.

"Sometimes in my sleep, sometimes they creep up on me. Sometimes they come to me like a locomotive."

"I like this one", his girlfriend Sarah yawned almost whining. She pointed to a painting with a woman wearing no pants, in fact nothing but a t-shirt that said "NO cooking". She rode a horse into space.

Jack also covered the walls in masses of text and melting heads. Quotes from Karouac, Burroughs and Ginsberg looked scribbled and yet smeared and softened. Some of the text was attached to torsos and huge brains, suspended as if in midair. It's as if someone sipped some ink and spat on the walls repeatedly. Pollack chewing tobacco in disgust. "Irregular atmosphere, timid and reluctant" was written in one corner. "Art space for drunks" was written in another.

Doc's shadow danced loudly against one of the curtains as he rummaged through a box of tools.

Andrew sat on the floor, rolling a joint on a crate. He licked his fingers and pressed them against the thin paper. His sockets were sunken in, naturally born that way. His face always looked either sad, indifferent or angry. Renee explained previously that he probably always felt like he was missing something and never found it. That something was probably his unborn twin, dead in the womb. He could never forget the memories he never had with his brother. His parents were worried he'd go through the rest of his life with regret. It certainly looked like they were winning their bet.

"So what are you doing these days Andy?" Renee asked him cheerfully.

Andrew rolled the joint between his fingers, responding casually without looking up at here, "Im working up at Cuppa Joe, also working on the script with Eric and Athena. We're sharing some of the dialogue and there's a big funeral scene with a eulogy. That's all I can say really."

He was obviously very uncomfortable. The marijuana smoke trailed up and swirled above his head in a halo. He took a sip and then handed it over to Jack. Sarah turned it down, but watched attentively.

"That's exciting!" Renee said with a huge grin, "I'm super happy for you! A movie, it really sounds like you're going places Andy!"

"Jack's in it too actually. He got a part as the protagonist's friends." Jack nodded in agreement. Sarah stared at Jack then off into space.

"Oh really?!" Renee squealed. "I didn't know they'd invite so many people on this, they were pretty secretive about it."

I wondered about what the movie was about.  Eric and Athena practiced ayahuasca once a month in a forest, puking the whole night. They called it purging. Athena painted pictures of flowers and giggled every other word. Eric was involved in two huge children's productions that made them well off for a while. They both wrote scripts for hollywood that couldn't make it past the noses of producers. But this time it was their movie, probably about something holistic.

"Yea they had auditions and yeeeeaaaa I can do that." but then he turned his attention to me, "Long time no see, so how's it going?" Jack patted me on the back, "How've you been, are you still working at the, what... The software thing? place?"

"Yea I'm still there."

"Well do you like it?" Sarah feigned interest in this until Renee led her off topic to her position as a secretary downtown.

"Yea it's alright, I don't know. I don't really like everything about my work."

"But is it FUN?" Jack looked at me. I was a bit surprised at how serious his tone was.

"Yea it's ok, I like programming I guess." I tried not to look at Andy. His presence made me uncomfortable, in fact the whole situation did.

"I talked to Matt, he's not too into it." Jack went on and on.

Jack must have felt the weird tension? How often did this situation occur, lovers of the past and past fight it out with passive aggressive blows. Andy and I hadn't talked in months. Our last conversation, typical of Andy, was how the universe was expanding but could barely accommodate anyone and people were dying. Andy knew, I was Renee's latest best friend supposably. We hadn't talked Andy was sullen, apathetic at first glance. But I'm sure it *dug* deep into him.

In the corner were records, piled on the ground. Mostly 80's new wave or early 90's American noise rock. Their jackets were worn and tired.

As we left I took a quick last look at Andy. He got up in fact, and in front of us all he looked me in the eye and said, "I forgive you" smiling, and shook my hand. His sockets sunk like battleships. I shook back blandly and headed towards the stairs, ignoring a snarl.

"You can come back and visit." Jack sleepily waved. The rest of the goodbyes procrastinated until we were out the door.

"Andy's changed! He's got a job and his life is getting stable. He's doing better," Renee was excited, almost blushing.

"Why do you care about someone who beat you?"

"He's just someone I still care about, he's a part of my life. You have to accept that. I've known him for so long."

And she tried to bring me back, "Hey! Come on! Don't worry of course I still love you. I'm with you now! Come on!" Renee laughed a whisper. I made a shut up smile. We walked back slowly in silence to the limo office, the only sound Renee's inner thighs rubbing against each other wearing down her jeans.

The receptionist was there. Behind the counter was a huge grin, a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She now hobbled busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone 3000km away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight. She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" She laughed hard. I picked through the letters. Renee took her phone bill and some sales flyers unabashed.

It had been a week, no notices. Apparently the government said nothing. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me. The cat hurled puddles of hiss and screams in our faces as we went in our apartment.

...

And yet even with all of these things... The art, the flex-rooms, the smoke, the dirt and the people, the room still was still so empty. They were just specks, if you winked you weren't sure they were there. Like nothing was sure to exist.
