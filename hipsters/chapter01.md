There were no curtains on my windows yet, but I somehow slept well into the late morning. I woke up still in a bizarre dream while Renee dozed next to me in a really thick sleep deep in a gutter. The bed springs shook as I got up, slowly, and they bit back audibly. Grabbing my jeans from the floor and a shirt from the rack, I slipped off the bed. The cat, Chibi, lay on a pile of our clothes looking up at me, tired and bloated. It watched me wander around the room. With its' eyes it asked me, "why are you awake, that's a pitiful thing to be."

The morning met my gaze. I felt my shirt was too big for me, like someone threw a blanket on a chair and it just sat there. The water pressure in the shower was still way too hard. It sprayed me like an elephant in a zoo, the drops pelting in a rage.

Everyday I shaved and tapped the razor handle against my hand to empty it. Renee said she could hear the tapping against the sink in her dreams. It was far too loud and she hated waking up in the morning to my tapping, tiny hair spraying against the sink so early. "No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." And she mimicked an exaggerated throw down of a huge razor to the floor.

The bag of my socks were under random bits of clothes and books. It was pretty late but the only way to find anything was  to start cleaning the house. We moved in recently with boxes unopened, half opened, opened for business, under restoration, national heritage, etc and etc. The room defined askew. And yet the irony was ironically built on top of yet more trash. Our apartment was above a shifty limousine dispatch, neighboring a recycling office.

I should mention the owners of the place were dodgy themselves. Two cousins from rich Indian families started it a century back. One absolutely never ever never for sure 100% never visited the office. His pictures were all over it with the latest limousine models. The other, simply nicknamed Raf, was shackled under house arrest for arranging prostitute rides for political clients. I found that out in a newspaper one day, on the coffee table in my office. The print read Raf talked behind their backs, calling the prime minister 'little dictator' while dispatching the driver and an unclassy broad. I was confused that day if mentioning the prostitutes was somehow clever or not. Oh and he was our landlord.

We arranged a deal with Raf that we'd pay to live in his illegally zoned apartment for nothing more.

After shifting the couch I found a pair. Renee moaned in her sleep softly but the wake of it was loud enough. You could still hear it as I shut the door quietly behind her.

Outside, the recycling station stood tall and solid. People were fast at work, trucks driving in and out recycled material, laughing loudly at each other just because. The bottles, cans, tins, broken glass, milk jugs, and whatever else bore the arrows symbol was sorted, tossed and recombined with each other. I wasn't clear exactly what they did with the recycling besides pack it. These people showed off their wealth of trash. One day it'll be useful, but now someone will figure something out.

Past the few warehouses, the territorial crows buzzed on one corner, some above my head. One in particular took to swooping down on me daily, nearly scathing my hair. So territorial. I ignored it completely though, it really wasn't worth it. The city was already awake and in full motion. Cars went places. The coffee shop lines were long and the trains were packed.

The sea of people ebbed and flowed to the train and I swam with them. I wondered about these strangers, and how strange they were. I wondered for a few moments where she went home, who he wanted to be, who are these people's parents, when were they born. Where do they think they're going and where are they actually going. Each person tried to sneak a silent look at the other. A cough gurgled up from somewhere buried in the crowd. Off the train, I hobbled through the crowds and up stairs.

"Michael good morning!" Michael just came out of the building and placed himself in a nook. He towered over the street and passing walkers, over me.

"Isn't it too early to smoke?"

"Morning Kubrick. It's not too early. -You're - not too early," he smiled.

"Yea well I wasn't really looking forward to today." I said casually, trying to mimic him, "This project never ends Michael."

"You've got to bear with it. We could say we fixed a whole state's license system by the end of this. It's a long haul."

People rushed across the intersection, most in suits and black skirts. The sky cleared a bit and shed some light on the dank dirty sidewalk.

I sputtered out, "But, today's gonna be hectic and quiet. Like a goldfish dying. I don't really see an end to any of this."

"What are you talking about?"

"I don't know, nothing. It's a long story."

"How long?" He coughed out.

"Well, Actually..." I paused. "it's a short or long story depending on how you tell it."

He chuckled a bit. His smile spelled out WHATEVER and waved me in. The morning air and slight heat mugged me one last time before the air conditioner gushed in my face.

It was sort of a race, I could never wake up early enough after the first two weeks to get to work on time. The walls of the office were painted off hue primary colors. Shy bold statements. As I laid on my desk, the usual suspects were already there programming. They pushed pixel after pixel.

The lazy hellos and good mornings were drilled out slowly like a list. My coworkers' clothes were sharp, crisp but not dapper. Lucius wore a tight button up with a wrinkled collar. Tyler distinctively cared less about his dress shirt than the stain on the front pocket, and put a button on it. The only chatter in every department were the computer keyboards whispering their damnedest. Every so often a private phone call came to life in a room buried in a corner somewhere.

I looked around at my coworkers as I sat down at my desk, but made sure it appeared like a quick twitch to not draw attention to myself. People engaged their whole hearts, a bit at a time, monotonously trying to make their work come alive. I could see it in their glazed eyes. Everyday we talked over problems. Made micro adjustments. We took ten of them and tore them up all at once. Everyone was terribly excited over these changes. We all thought, these problems existed to be solved. Driver license systems needed to be overhauled, redone. Pictures needed cropping. Reports needed to be created. Claims needed to be challenged with more data. How would we graph it, how could we get more information out of them?

Mik walked in the room, "Well good morning?" it came out like a question, his dutch accent thick and pronounced. I nodded and smiled back at him a good morning. Mik was a product manager committed to creating the most relaxed environment possible. The day proceeded and time was butchered into planning, lunch and typing. Oh, and clicking. We compiled lists of items and descriptions of them. We drew what they could look like out and threw most of them away.

Midday our business analyst Ryan sifted through photos. "There is no difference," Ryan interrupted no one, "from hipsters and the homeless. It's really really hard to tell the difference." Tom chuckled and relaxed into a smile. Ryan peered over at me.

"Do you know the difference?" He directed it at me.

"I think homeless people have more fashion sense I guess?" Tom muttered smiling.

But I intentionally ignored them and zoned out. I zoned out a few times daily. To what I can't remember. To random things.

Lunch came and left. Four in the afternoon clocked in and left shortly after. I couldn't tell but felt it, felt how time was lucky like that. Literally leaving any time it wanted.

You have to understand. I tried to build it so it could speak to me. The screen should have screamed something intelligible instead of staring back at me, blandly holding up the garbage boxes and font I drew on it.

At six or so everyone began shaking their things, feeling a bit uneasy. Someone ruffled their coat onto themselves, and then pretended to realize it was time to go.

I packed my things and left. Out the door, into the street, on the crowded train. Past them, past the burden that beckoned me to come back again tomorrow. I didn't meet anyone's gaze, no one did mine. The crows swooped above me. The recycling shop was closed, thousands of bottles and cans snug, sleeping and snoozing in clear plastic bags. I shut my apartment door, the cat whined and whined inside. No purring whatsoever.

Renee was awake, but I was unsure if she went to the clinic or not. It was impossible to tell. Sitting in bed, topless, her posture and nudity fit a greek aristocratic she-lump. What played in front of her was the most unimaginable imaginable television. Horror movies with identical endings, relationship finales foreshadowing later romps.

"How was your day, Om? What did you do?" a seedless grape slid down Renee's mouth.

"Nothing happened today. Things happened that were less than nothing today." I murmured.

"Om can you turn on the washing machine again? I forgot to put the clothes in the dryer. Wash them again so they don't get moldy."

"Did you happen to check the mail?" I perked my ears up a bit.

"No, I had to hurry to work today and didn't have time. I didn't feel like waiting for them, seems busy now too." Her eyes were still glued to the screen, the cat yawned for attention.

"I'm trying to be patient I swear..." I flipped through my vinyl and wondered which record would numb effectively. Most were hygenicized, trapped in clear plastic. The 70's, 80's, 90's underground flip by. Nothing was jarring enough to procrastinate to. I shed so many tears over those new wave, no wave, ho wave genres and perhaps they dulled me. Good or bad goosebumps with every listen. Finally I settled on something with a really light voice I couldn't quite hear the lyrics to some ambient piano, and started up dinner.

The kitchen was a tiny mess compared to the living room. Dishes weren't piled high enough to call it a disaster. I don't remember what I cooked that night, but I do remember it was bland. I was following a diet Renee had dedicated herself to; she wasn't allowed anything fermented, with spice, with meat, ground or with dairy. "Sacrifice, I've been doing it my whole life." She said vigilantly and proud. "Everyone has to write their own story Om. I'm writing my own story, you're in it too." By now I was used to these broad statements. They were one of the reasons I loved her, the insistence and necessity she gave her language. The way she used them to feel independent and smart. I took her challenge as an excuse to make something creative. My mouth took it as a challenge to taste any flavor.

Outside stood the vacant parking lots and warehouses, limos occasionally driving to and fro. The window made a frame with the distant city and the reddening horizon. The New York sun wasn't at all like the sun back in Lebanon. Somehow it felt bigger there, pulsing with blood and vigor as it slid down the sky.

I sometimes forgot the sun existed in New York. It didn't mean as much to me but I felt it should have. I desperately wanted to love it.

Then after dinner I slid downstairs, but they said nothing came that day. There was no mail.
