Something in the air was broken. Cars swept by and cats snarled. The area was deep with unrestricted access. The venue itself was tucked above two garages. The owners soldered on a roof with a roof, threw old wood in they were too lazy to dump and charged triple its worth. There was a skylight though, so you knew you could always leave. The space itself was huge, boxed and sanded down with sooted corners. The renters hung a sign outside:

"Guitar lessons? Dance space rental? Warm bodies? Call us."

It was pretty obvious this venue, nicknamed 'The Woods', wasn't going to last much longer than eight or so months. Three thousands of dollars of rent per 30 days was high budgeted even for the 6 renters, especially when the only real job any of them held was barely. At the end of each month they worried, sweatily fumbling. Keeping themselves in check and sober was key, but no amount of coffee or cigarettes could hold back the day the rent was due.

Then there were parties. Then there was us. Stuffed up against the brick wall as if hung on it, the three of us watched couples and triples go inside. We were determined to be a desperate plea for attention and as nonchalant about it as possible. It was 10 o'clock, waiting for the show to start, probably soon.

"You think Matt'll come?" I asked.

"Which Matt, what are you talking about?" Ryan said, half laughing.

"The guy, Matt, in the band."

"Band guy? Yea he's coming."

Jack pulled out his lighter for the 3rd time and lit a cigarette. I looked blankly at both of them.

"Hey man can I have one?" Ryan asked.

"You *just* had one."

"So did you..."

"But these are mine? Come on obviously you had a lot."

"But *one* cigarette man. One," Ryan opened his dear deer eyes in the headlights style. His puppy face became pronounced.

"Ok, but you bummed the last one off me, you owe me two now." And Jack gave Ryan a peace sign. Ryan kept it and took the cigarette.

My next guess is Matt never shows up. He was usually late and occasionally we'd get pissed at him but we were usually late too. High expectations abound, no one was happy. At least we had cigarettes I don't smoke.

We stood around, scratchy and unnerved. We looked like a shitty polaroid. I started to drift from Jack and Ryan here. These two were innocent compared to the hidden gems inside. I didn't know who depressed me more.

Jack and Ryan were tacked on friends. I met them both in university. Ryan was a straight A+ student until college grabbed him by the collar and shoved him into a lazy comma. He remained high on marajuana for eternity. Jack talled and lanked his way through height and immeasurable incongruency. Various college degrees tried to swoop down on him, but he was great at planking them and none caught him but philosophy. Until shoulder length hair, chittering and shoes for "no shoes no service" are finally outlawed, Jack will reign down punching faces with abstract canvases of modern nude art.

I could tell the two of them were getting finicky. Jack finished his cigarette in a few minutes and, "but seriously man I'm gonna bail. I'm really sorry, but I've got this thing with Sarah tonight and it's like you know me I'm sorry." His sentence bowed, shuffled and shrugged.

"It's not a big deal, you don't have to apologize. I'll see you later though, like another night."

"Really sorry I can't right now."  And he slowly walked off waving, with Ryan bumbling and lagging behind him whispering a "me too."

How a show usually played out is posters go up in skate shops, coffee shops, really expensive barbershops with 3 items on the menu. Doors at 8, starts at 9. People know it really starts at 10. Bands keep waiting for their drinks and drunks. They go on at 11 or 11:30. It ends at 4am after the fourth band, but the police break it up at 3am.

This isn't that kind of show though, we don't technically really have to wait for anyone. It's 90's Dance night and that's a guaranteed win. Everyone here was an angry teenager then wanting to dye some highlights into their memories. Now we're back. But instead we have 60's pop remakes we forgot about on the radio, and they're in vogue again. One night only until the next 90's dance party five months from now.


By now people stupided towards the door, a few already drinking, a few more warming up with headbands. Some beards were abound, a few lit up.

I flew in profusely inside like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened in front of crowds. Some bumped into me accidentally and intentionally. A few jeered at nothing then laughed.

The party was a pagan dance. 90's theme be damned. Someone threw up the 60's, 70's, 90's (but mostly the eighties) onto some far and not finely aged wasted teenage bodies. Everyone was clad with chababyness. The dance floor was surrounded with quotation marks. Fashion was ripe with faux-paus chic and undeniable clashing that somehow made the word "tacky" look tame. Two were dancing the robot like humans. Straight out of Wonderland were Alices in all colors of the rainbow. A ghostbuster did a violent shuffle near a spinster, backpack jigging and all.

Many weirds and beards shot each other, the digital polaroids barely drying between takes. Mouths were open, strung out on jargon, cheap beer and dance music. Some girls made a few soft-core poses, each holding a meaningless subliminal message.

I scanned through the crowds casually. The lights were dim and confused, spraying in every other direction. I recognized a few passing faces in passing.  A few more prominent and active members ignored me. I made a hard nod at one girl made tapestries. Finally Selina waded into the crowd. I caught fleeting glimpses of Adrian and her periodic boyfriend. They were lost in a few ways, most prominently in dancing.

"What up yo?" Selina and I pounded hands and laughed. She donned light flannel and a grey cap.

"Yo yo yo. You're looking really grungy."

"I've been wearing this since this morning! How long have you been here?" Her smile was huge.

"Not that long, like half an hour. Thought I would check it out."

"Ch-check-ch-check-ch-cheking it out!" She tried to yell over the bad dance style. Most of the moves around us were just people walking badly.

What was popular possibly eons ago started to play again. We danced a few jigs and tried to steal a few dance moves from our surroundings, but it only looked like everyone was badly walking. We just shuffled left and right and looked around us.

About 20 minutes later Adrian formed out of thin air and pulled Selina by the arm miming a smoker. I followed them outside, and the cold air hit us once again.

"Hey we've got to jam twice this week so we're ready for Saturday." Selina looked up at me as she lit up, and I fanned away wafts of marijuana.

"Ah yea ~no kidding~." she blew out and coughed a bit. "Oh did you get your papers yet?" with an earnest.

"Not yet, it's going to take a while."

"Whatever, government. THE GOVERNMENT!" She yelled. Selina was against everything government. She gauffed at capitalism and stood honestly in disbelief at the many injustices of the world mentioned to her. Her eyes would literally grow bigger if anyone mentioned grim crimes involving theft, extortion, brutalizing women or death. "Oh my god" she would usually exclaim between sips from her latte.

Adrian took a toke next to her with her boyfriend Hayden. I never really did know what to say to her friend. She worked in a coffee shop day in day out, surrounded by people who looked familiar but I didn't know. She gave Selina free coffee every time she visited with soy milk of course thanks. She coughed it up a bit, her face red. She talked to Selina.

"How long do you wanna stay? I saw Steve inside, we could go to his house afterwards. Kind of an after party thing."

"I'm up for that, he's a good guy. Wait, Steve Flemer? Or Steve from 'No Hope?'"

"From No Hope." Adrian yelled, laughing. "Who's the other guy?"

They trailed off into a world of drama. I turned to Hayden, also slunked against the brick wall, and ask him what exactly was up. He said nothing in particular, which was nothing. A distintive ambiguous shrug. Hayden was between jobs, working as a graphic designer for a business by the waterfront.

-----

Adrian led us back to Steve's house. A fair oodle of people were inside. The place was barely furnished, toppled in and out of itself. a mattress, love seat and small table were occupied in the living room. We sat down next to these stranger and strangers underneath the projector.  Steve started up some indian music. Obviously he was heavily influenced by these rhythms to be in his other band, Boombastic. This environment sat nicely with the rest of the people hanging out there. All friends of his roommates or friends. They passed around some sort of marijuana and pill I didn't recognize. I didn't bother to take either off their hands.

Steve was hard at work entertaining Adrian and Hayden. His voice fit so well in the background I couldn't distinguish it first whe he turned to me, "Why don't you smoke up?"

"I'm not so sure I'd be happy with the results."

"I don't know man sometimes it's nice to find out what those are. But that's cool." I nodded at a few more things he said muffled by the music and the crowd, and he went back to Adrian promptly.
