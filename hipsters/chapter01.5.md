Ch1.5.

"Hello?"

"Hey big guy! How are you?"

"I'm doing alright Dad."

"How's the job?"

"It's going ok, you know it's going. How are you?"

"I'm doing good, your Mom has problems."

"What happened to Mom?" I hastened a wave goodbye to Selina as a shock enveloped me.

"Oh she just depressed about some things, You should call her more. I always try to make her happy. She's fine, don't worry though. When are you coming to visit son?"

"I told you Dad I can't come back without the visa. Are you sure about Mom?"

"When do you think you'll have it?"

"I'm not sure honestly, some time soon I hope. I check my mail everyday."

"You said that last time, we just haven't seen you in forever."

"I told you," I said sighing, "You can come here anytime."

A shuffling then a pause, "Well son for everyone to come it's not possible. Anyway, your brothers will be here in May so if you can make it please come."

I leaned on a wall with a sign commanding to "POST NO BILLS". "If anything changes I'll come as soon as possible."

"Ok good."

"Is Mom ok?"

"No, she's not ok. I wanted to tell you your Mom had an asthma attack."

"She's had them before."

"Yes, she has but it's getting worz(s)e."

"Worse." My chapped lips, I could feel them now, said the word a bit too loud it surprised myself.

"Well the doctor said she take a lot of rest."

I paused. My Dad did too and he hated them. Usually he filled these with questions, even rarely bits of family I've never heard of. "You know, your cousin Najlah is getting married." ((Conversation dust that spills out of holes and muddies the water.)) Didn't really want to venture there though.

"So what is the plan?"

"Well the plan is to take teh medicine and see how she does. But she would really like to see you son. Can you call her?"

"Is she there?"

"She's asleep now. But she will be up in the morning."





"Yes she's fine. No problem. I'm just talking son. Did you reach the next level at your job, son? When are you going to be the manager? Are you managing people?"

"The next level? No not yet."

"Ok well please do son. You know it's what's best for your future. I'm only giving advice and my opinion, but it's for your future."

"I know Dad."

"Ok well son I'm going to go. Say hi to what's her name? The french one?"

"Renee. Yes I'll say hi to her."

"Ok great. Have a good day son. Ok Bye."

"Bye Dad."

Fairly later, our company's gym sponsored a cruise once a year. Its' hopes were to spin some people around the rivers while pitching their guests to join a year long contract to sweat, hoping they just pay and don't actually show up.
