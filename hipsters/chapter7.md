__With Adrian__

Adrian began discussing her family for a bit. People in her story were drunk, had financial problems. Selina and I echoed "Yea I know that's hard."

"I don't know what to do about my Dad. I don't know what to do. So many family issues and nothing gets resolved, you know?" She was talking strictly to Selina.

"No kidding that's hard." Selina stared out into the street. For a bit we drove in her bug silently. The radio coughed up something we didn't recognize, but we were lulled by it and the static with every turn down a street. A few cats were lying on sidewalks waiting to be petted.

"Did you hear about Darren?" Adrian said, her voice a bit less scratchy.

 Selina woke up "No, what about him? Didn't he have a show recently?" I could see Adrian was still, her mouth straightened and formed slowly, over the next few minutes, into a frown.

 "Him and Gabe were playing a show at The Laundry Room the other day. With his band Hellen Killer? You know. Darren thought that it would be cool if he brought some lighter fluid right? It would be a great show. He dumped a bit on his guitar and lit it on fire, and continued to play as much as he could. But the space is pretty small, and the fire slowly got out of control. That space is pretty small though, and it's all wood. And while he was taking his guitar off he kicked the lighter fluid into the crowd. This girl ended up catching on fire and the paramedics came. It was 2 a.m. and everyone was panicking."

"****" I said, any expression had before fell to the floor of the car, rolling back and forth as we turned.

"What happened to the girl?" Selina whispered in shock.

"Well the horrible thing is she ended up in the hospital with two degree burns. Everyone is blaming them and berating Darren and Gabe any way they can. On their flyers too now. It's horrible. They visited the girl in the hospital a few times and apologized." Adrian then turned to Selina, stern, "It didn't make a difference. Also The Laundry Room is gone, it burnt down that night. No one can play there any more. The whole place was made of wood."

"God, that's horrible." Selina said.

"No one stops telling them they're jerks. I mean no one thinks about it. Darren feels horrible and they don't have to make him feel any worse. They probably won't play for months too."






...

Talk at concert about circuit bending, blabbing to friends about how big of an annoyance talking about it with someone was.

talk about how bands isnt great, get told off.

"I actually didn't like the song about Mexico City."
I could barely hear him when he yelled "Why?!".
And I said I just didn't like it. Of course no one was allowed to say it but I truly thought it and gave it a shot. I didn't care about him not caring how much his voice syntha-sized sucked.
"No no no. You don't understand man. You don't understand. It was brazilian minimal techno, a mix of brian eno's best dance stuff he was doing in the late 90's. Hip hop, you know mexican hip-hop? You'll have to listen to it again I don't believe you you just don't understand it"...
I said "Yea, maybe I don't understand it."
"No it's ok you have to realize this is great."
And like that soon we faded awkwardly into a crowd of awkwards.
