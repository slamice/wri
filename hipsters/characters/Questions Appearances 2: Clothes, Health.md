Clothes: What does she normally wear? Designer clothes? Work clothes? Casual? Salvation Army? Are her clothes generally revealing? Does she wear miniskirts and low-cut blouses? Or does she tend to cover every inch, wearing skirts down to her ankles and modest, oversize sweaters? Does she wear large straw hats, tie her hair back with bandannas? Accoutrements? Handbags, jewelry, watches? A ring on every finger? A large, golden cross about her neck? Large hoop earrings? A nose ring? A tattoo on her shoulder? Is she more likely to wear Rolex and Guccis, or sandals and a five- dollar watch off the street? Does she dress more expensively than she can afford, or does she dress down despite her wealth? What colors does she tend to wear? All black? Neon pink? Does she have a good sense of fashion? Are her clothes in line with the latest trend, or ten years out of style?

Grooming: Is she tailored, impeccably dressed, or an unkempt, unbathed slob? Does she shower twice a day, or once a week? Does she smell? Does she wear too much perfume?
Body language: Does she stand stiffly, or is she always slumped over? Does she walk in a feminine manner, swaying her hips as she goes, or does she walk like a man, as if looking for a fight?

Voice: Some people can be picked out of a room by voice alone. Does she have a forceful, booming voice? Can her conversations be heard across the room? Or does she talk in a whisper, hardly audible, so you always have to ask her to repeat herself? Is her voice high or low? Nasal and whiny, or clear? Is it the perfectly neutral, businesslike voice of a telemarketing professional, or is it the husky, suggestive voice of a prostitute? Does she talk with great speed, in a manic rush? Or does she beat around the bush, talking so slowly that you watch the clock as you wait for her to finish? Does she stutter? Have an accent? A lisp?

What details might you add that you may not have thought of previously?

If you were to ask your character her analysis of herself, would there be any discrepancy? Does she consider herself in line with fashion while wearing outdated clothes? Does she think her voice is sexy though it is loud and piercing? Does she
think her jewelry not fancy enough while wearing a gigantic diamond ring? What do these discrepancies say about the character? Do they point to any greater issue?

The Doctor
You are one of the top doctors in the country, and your specialty is diagnosing hard-to-name illnesses. You have just been referred your toughest case yet. He has been to ten doctors in as many months, and no one can find what's wrong with
him. He sits across from you now on his first visit, ready for you to inquire into his medical history. Medical Background

How is his general constitution? Can he not get sick in the middle of a jungle, or does he get sick within one hundred feet of someone's germs? Has he ever been seriously sick? With what? How many times? Was it hereditary? If not, how did he contract it (in a foreign country, sleeping with someone)? Was he ever hospitalized? What was that like? How much of an impact have his illnesses had on his life? How much do they have right now?
Does he have a chronic illness or condition? Is he on any medication? Asthma inhaler, blood pressure regulators, antidepressants? How often must he take it, and how does it affect his life? (For a diabetic, his illness—his constant monitoring of
food, blood sugar, and injections of insulin—will be a major part of his life.) Are there side effects? Interactions? How must he compensate (not drink, not smoke, adopt a special diet)?

Has he ever been injured? How? (A sports injury, a fight, a car accident?) Broken bones? Plastic surgery? Bad back, tendinitis, arthritis? Does he have any disabilities? Is he blind, deaf, lame,
mute, mentally challenged? Is he insane? Schizophrenic?

Now apply these questions to the character(s) in your work. What details might you incorporate that you may not have thought of previously?

If you were to ask your character his analysis of himself, would there by a discrepancy? Does he consider himself sick although he is perfectly healthy? Is he a hypochondriac?
