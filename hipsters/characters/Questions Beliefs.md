Inherent Abilities: If someone is born with an innate ability (or disability) it can be a defining factor in his life—whether he spends his life embracing it or running from it, it will always be there. For Mozart or Michelangelo, their inherent abilities defined their lives. If one's IQ is 82 or 250, this is something that cannot be ignored; if one is psychic or dyslexic or color-blind or has an attention deficit disorder, this may have importance. Is he intelligent? Quick-witted? Or is he slow? Dull? Uncomprehending? Can he run with
Olympic speed? Throw a ball two-hundred yards? Does he have an incredible singing voice? Can he speed-read? Is he a contortionist? A master pianist? (Shine)

Religion: Although it often lurks beneath the surface in society today, mention a potential spouse and see how long it takes until your parents inquire about their religion. Walk the streets on Sunday mornings and you'll find most stores closed;
enter a department store in December and you will be besieged by Christmas music. Whether we admit it or not, religion is a defining factor in our society and can be a defining factor in an individual's makeup.
In actuality, religion may play a huge part in a person's life, or no part at all. Either route is telling. Catholic? Jewish? Protestant? Muslim? Buddhist? Mormon? Hare Krishna? Is he observant? To what degree? Does he keep Sabbath? Shun pork? Does she wear a cross, attend daily confessional? Does he keep Ramadan? How big a role does religion play in his life? How observant is he in relation to the rest of his family? If he is observant but comes from a family that's not, it is telling; likewise if he is not observant but comes from a family that is. Is he out of touch with his religion? Would he like to know more? Is he on the verge of an awakening? Is she on the verge of turning her back on it? Does he live with religious guilt? How will he raise his kids? How does she want to raise hers? Is there conflict?

Spirituality: A person may be observant of his religion's rituals and yet deep down not believe in God. What is this person's relationship to God? Does he believe? If so, how strongly? How much thought has he given it? Have there been moments when, perhaps faced with death or great joy, he believed? Have there been moments when, faced with great evil or tragedy, he lost his belief? What triggered them, and what might trigger them again? Does he believe deeply in God, but not believe his religion's rituals? Or is he an atheist? Agnostic? Does he follow the latest New Age trends? Unfortunately, there is often a correlation between suffering and one's devoutness, especially if a person is coming to spirituality on his own. When did this person become religious? What triggered it? A death? Retirement?

Identity: At different points in our lives we play different roles. Parent, son, husband, student, employee . . . Ultimately these are all just roles, but often a person's very identity becomes wrapped up in them. People particularly tend to identify
themselves with their career paths. For a policeman or a priest, a sense of identity might even be completely synonymous with the profession.
People often complain about their jobs, but when asked why they won't consider a new profession, they answer, "What else am I going to do?" They list a host of reasons that they can't risk trying anything else—wife, kids, house, mortgage, car payments—but often, deep down, it seems the other way around: A part of them has sought out these obligations so that they will no longer have to consider the possibility of a change. It takes great energy to consider many paths, and options can be paralyzing. After a point, whether the path is the best one is not as important as the fact that it is chosen. A certain sort of existential anxiety is abated, and one can proceed with confidence, channeling his energies toward one goal. This is the confidence of a man in his forties or fifties. What has he sacrificed for it?

Beliefs: A person's beliefs can be his defining characteristic— indeed, some will die for what they
believe. Is he prejudiced? A skinhead? Does he attend KKK meetings? (Or is he a white man married to a black woman despite having been raised in a racist home?) Has he been indoctrinated by a cult? Has she chained herself to a tree to help save the rain forests? Does he bash gays on weekends?
The source of the beliefs are as important as the beliefs themselves. How many of his beliefs are the result of his own thought and how many the result of the influence of a parent, teacher, sibling, friend, movie, book, geography, economic status? Was he strong enough to resist these sources? At what age was he influenced by others? (For instance, Hitler did not become an anti-Semite until he was in his early twenties, when he was first subjected to widespread anti-Semitic literature and speakers.)
Programs: Programs are beliefs that lurk unconsciously beneath the surface, beliefs a person is unaware he has. For instance, he may have been raised during the Depression and as a result might go through life feeling as if money is scarce. Or he may have been raised by a parent who always told him he was stupid, and as a result might unconsciously feel that way. Or he may have experienced traumatic events that left deep, lasting impressions and cause him to relive the events for the rest of his life—like the abused child who attracts abusive partners in later life. What recurring themes or programs run through your character's life? Is he always short on money? Always in a volatile relationship?

Similarly, what is his sense of self-worth? Why doesn't he have all the money in the world, the CEO position, the beautiful girl, the huge house? Does he truly feel entitled to these things? If not,
what programs are stopping him?

Ethics: How ethical is this person? Will he fudge a resume? Inform a waitress if she left something off the check? Tell a cashier if she gave him a ten dollar bill instead of a single? Will he turn in a wallet he finds in a dark movie theater? Are his
ethics dictated by the amount at hand? How principled is he, and what is his breaking point? If unethical, is he self-aware? Or, like most unethical people, does he use sophistry to convince himself that his actions are okay? Ethics (and their misuse) are at the core of many works— many plots revolve around finding a character's ethical breaking point. In works like The Godfather, Michael Cor-leone undergoes an ethical and moral odyssey, from abstaining from the family business to becoming enmeshed to the point where he would kill his own brother. His motives for entering the business are pure (to protect his father), but as he gets more involved he finds himself in an ethical dilemma (to protect his family or to murder others), and in one sense this work is about finding his ethical breaking point. In Wall Street, the son is drawn to increasingly greater power and fortune, but at the same rate his ethics are tested, to the point where he could destroy his own father's company for financial gain. The Boiler Room revolves around a similar theme.

Sex: In the previous chapter, we glanced at our character's surface romantic history—marriages, divorces, significant others, partners. As we probe deeper, into the part of the psyche that only we— as writers—can know about, we must know everything. What are this person's sexual preferences? Is she wild in bed? Is he unable to perform? Is he a virgin at thirty-five? Has she slept with five men by age fifteen? Is he a prude or does he believe in free love? When was your character's first sexual experience? Was it positive or negative? What has this person been raised to think about sex? Was it ever discussed? Was he raised by homosexual parents? Was he abused? What sort of partners has he
attracted in the past? What does that say about him? How do his choices resemble his parents'? Does he have any sexually transmitted diseases? How has this affected his life? Does he want sex five times a day? Does she want sex once a month? Is she careful about
protection? Is he careless? Is he into S&M? Does he frequent porn shops and peep shows? Will she refuse to even mention the word? What does this person look for in a mate? What type of ad would he place in the personals?

Motivation: What drives this person? What are his secret hopes? Dreams? Goals? What does he aspire to? What's in his way? Most of us live our lives trying to better whatever position we find ourselves in, instead of choosing a direction and pursuing it. For example, a college graduate lands a job at an advertising agency and, once immersed in that environment, can only focus on bettering his position within that company. How quickly he can lose sight of any greater goals, particularly if they weren't firm to begin with. Now is the chance to step back. What might his goals have been?
What motivates him? Money? Approval? Power? The fear of security? The need to provide for a family? Find a person's current obstacles, no matter how small, and you will likely find what he dwells on for most of his day. If the person is a child, he will likely dwell on his parents, the obstacles to freedom; if he is an employee, he will likely dwell on his boss or whatever obstacle lies in the way of his bettering his position. (The obstacle can also be abstract—for instance, the lack of a proper education.)
Friendships: For many, friends can be a defining factor in their lives. For instance, most cops and firemen will spend their free time with other cops and firemen; most military men will spend time with other military men. Who does he choose to spend time with? Coworkers, old college or high school buddies? What are his friends like? Are they crude, arrogant, insensitive? Are they a bad influence? Or are they successful, overachievers? Are they all celebrities? Are they all single at thirty-five? Are her friends all married at twenty? Are they all richer than her? Poorer? Prettier? Uglier? More educated? Less? What does that say about her?
Does he have few friends or many? Is he an introvert? A loner? Or is he an extrovert? Gregarious? Does he know everyone in town? Will he talk to everyone at a party?

Conversational Focus: Y)u can learn a tremendous amount about people simply by observing what they choose to talk about. They might say they are merely rehashing the day's news when telling you a story about a local homicide, but the fact remains that they have chosen a morbid topic.
More tellingly, if you spend enough time with people, you'll find there is a recurring pattern to their conversational choices: They will often harp on the same themes, whether it is money, real estate, deaths, marriages, or child care; the funnies or the obituaries; the latest technology or the thirteenth century; fashion or fly fishing or the stock market. Conversation reflects what's on the mind. People do our jobs for us—they reveal themselves, if only we would listen. The problem is, we rarely listen carefully enough.
Self-awareness: Is he conscious of how others perceive him? Aware of his own shortcomings? His own strengths? Does he work to better himself? Does he see a psychiatrist, practice meditation,
experiment with New Age methods? Can he admit he is wrong? Or does he live in a world of his own making, completely out of touch with reality? Does he see himself as beneficent while everyone else sees him as a monster? Does he consider himself brilliant and subtle, while everyone else sees him as stupid and obvious?

Values: What are the priorities in this person's life? God? Family? Work? Love? Power? Ethics? Erudition? If forced to choose between his wife and his work, which would he choose? If asked to do something unethical for his company, would he do it? Will he attend college at any cost? Will he leave his family to fight for his country?

Allocation of Time: Go through a weekday with him. A weekend. How does he spend his day? How much time is spent on what activities? How much of it is intellectual? Athletic? Mindless entertainment? Does he read Dostoyevsky in his free time or play Nintendo? Does he write poetry or frequent bars? Or both? Does he spend time with his kids or take care of his parents? Does he spend time with his girlfriend or spend time with his dog? Does he attend church twice a day or frequent sex shows? Or both? If he were to go on vacation, what would he do? Would he be restless, bored in two hours? Or would he be content to sit and read and think for days on end?
Artistic Impulse: The strength of one's artistic urge—and whether or not he has the ability, means, and forum to express that urge—is often of supreme importance. Hitler considered himself foremost an artist; what propelled him to his ultimate embitterment was his rejection from an art academy. If he had been accepted as an artist, the world might be different than it is today. For Nero, one of the greatest tyrants of all time, the fact that he was a world leader was less important to him than the fact that he was a singer, actor, and poet. Indeed, his final words were: "What an artist the world has lost."

Is your character an artist of some sort (painter, musician, writer, dancer, actor)? Does he do it on the side, or as a full-time job? If on the side, does he aspire to do it for a living? Has he tried to break through? What has he done? What instruments does he play? A guitar? Violin? The tuba? The drums? Is he any good? Does he play loudly in order to drive people crazy? Does he live in a happy home, but paint angry, dark faces? Is he a prig who nonetheless sculpts phallic symbols? What does this say about him?
If he exhibits nothing on the surface, is there repressed cre-ativity in there somewhere? Is he a doctor penning a novel? A lawyer doing stand-up comedy? Is he a failed writer and thus a critic? A failed actor and now a casting agent?
Or has he never created anything in his life? Is he solely a laborer? Is he a pure businessman, banker, lawyer, doctor?
Heroes: When we are young, we have heroes. But as we age, as figures loom less large in our consciousness and we become more cynical about the creation of image, we are less quick to choose and maintain role models for ourselves. If forced, most of us will conveniently choose someone who is dead. Choose people who are alive. Who are your characters' heroes? If "hero" is too strong a word, think "role model"; if that is too strong, think someone they "look up to." We are all a
mixed bag, and you might choose someone who is admirable in one area even if he is despicable in another. Do not expect all things from all people. They could be actors, musicians, humanitarians, politicians, soldiers, businessmen, mothers____
What does his choice (or refusal to choose) say about him? About what he values in life? What steps is your character taking to follow in the same path? Why or why not?
Politics and Ideology: Politics seem to sit in the background in America today, but if you bring up a political issue in a group of people, you'll find that nearly all have strong opinions, and nearly all differ. It is indeed rare to initiate a political discussion without walking away with a major argument and at least some venom. This is why many people will not discuss politics over a meal.
Is he Democrat? Republican? Independent? Liberal? Conservative? Anti-apartheid? For big tobacco? Is he pro death penalty? Pro gun? Is she anti-abortion?
Relationship to Authority: Is he a rigid authoritarian? Would he report you to the police if you ran a red light? Is he part of the establishment? Does he commute nine to five with the same group of people? Is he a member of a country club, on the board of several community committees? Or is he a rebel? An independent thinker? Will he refuse to hold a job, pay his bills? Is he always fighting the IRS, the Department of Motor Vehicles? How big of a part does his relationship to authority play in his life?
Vices: Vices can be incidental in a person's life, or they can be a defining factor. Is he a drug addict? An alcoholic? A chain-smoker? A chronic gambler? A sex addict? Has he ever tried drugs? Did it tarnish his record? Or, conversely, will he never drink? Can he not stand to be in a room where there is smoke?

Time Line: Most of us spend our time either reminiscing about the past or anticipating the future. Does your character spend most of his time reminiscing? Remembering old grudges? Thinking of an ex- partner? A deceased loved one? Regretting opportunities missed? Or is he always anticipating? Does he plan his life ten years in advance? Have a retirement fund set up at age twenty? Quietly bide his time, content to dream of a future promotion? Or does he live only for today? Refuse to think back, refuse to plan? Y)u can also play against the grain. Is he a teenager who is always talking

about his memories? An old man who is always thinking of the future?
Relationship to Food: A character's relationship to food can be a defining factor. Does he eat five times a day? Once a day? Does he gorge himself with massive amounts of food? Does he hardly eat at all? Is he obese? Anorexic? A vegetarian? A vegan? Strictly kosher? Is he addicted to caffeine? Chocolate? Is he lactose-intolerant? Allergic to white flour?
Are SpaghettiOs his idea of a good meal? Is caviar hers? Does he live on fast food? Does she insist on the nicest restaurants? Is his refrigerator always empty? Is her kitchen always full? Does he not know how to cook? Does she spend half the day over her stove? Are his table manners awful? Are hers priggish? How much time, energy, and money does this person devote to food? How big of a role does it play in her life? What steps must he take to conform his life to his eating habits? Live near
kosher restaurants? Wake up at 5 a.m. to get in the first meal?
Habits: A professional hit man will watch his target. Within a few days, he'll find that his target sticks to nearly the same schedule every day—leaves the house at the same time, takes the same train ... If he watches long enough, his job is done for him.

We are ultimately creatures of habit, especially as we get older. Does your character wake up at the same time every day? Go through his same morning routine—eat breakfast, read the paper, take the car, ride the train? Does he hang his shirts on the same side of the closet, tuck his shoes in the same
corner? Does he frequent the same deli every day at 4 p.m. for his cup of coffee? Go to the same movie theater every Saturday night? Frequent the same hair salon the first Monday of every month? Vacation in the same place the last week of August every year? Is he a morning person, up every day at the crack of dawn? Or a night person, not awake until until 4 p.m.? Is he irascible in the mornings? Mindless at night?

Quirks: What peculiar quirks might this person have introduced into his life? Does he always need to carry an umbrella, just in case? Does he groom his dog every day? Does he feed the pigeons? Do irrational things set him off? People who are loud? Cigarette smoke? Does he hate the radio? Love LPs? Will he shun turtlenecks? Does she walk around nude?
Hobbies: Does he collect coins? Does she sew? Does he tinker with his car? Play poker every Thursday? Does she play bridge? Frequent flea markets? What sports does he play? Does he sail? Rock climb? Rollerblade? Go white-water rafting? Go to the gym? Does she play tennis? Swim? Play squash? Run three miles every morning? Is he a black belt in karate? Do they bowl as a couple? Which of these hobbies does he do alone? Which does she do with others? Who are their companions?
Charity: One can be generous and yet still not give to charity. For others, charitable work can be a defining aspect of their lives. How much of his money does he donate to charity? How much of his time? Does he volunteer for causes? Donate blood? Does he work for a nonprofit foundation? Join the Peace Corps?
Conversely, has he never given to charity, despite having
millions? Is he a celebrity who refuses to make even one charitable appearance? Has he been forced into giving to charity or doing charitable work? Does he do it grudgingly? For political reasons? Does he do it anonymously? Or with great fanfare?

EXERCISES
• The Personality Test. Below find a list of positive and negative character traits. For each trait, rate your character on a scale of 1 to 10, on both the positive and negative side. For instance, if your character is always generous and never cheap, you would put a 10 in the generous column and a 0 in the cheap column; if he is mostly generous but sometimes cheap, you might put a 7 in the generous column and 3 in the cheap column. People are a compendium of conflicting traits, and a person can
 
easily be generous in some areas but cheap in others. When you have finished the test, tally up each side. Overall, is the number higher on the positive or negative side? By how much? Which traits are most pronounced? What has this taught you about your character?

Negative Positive
_Jealous? Covetous? Wish everyone the best? _Cheap? _Generous?
_Spiteful, vindictive? _Forgiving? _Stubborn? _Pliable?
_Suspicious, paranoid? _Trusting? _Controlling? _Easygoing?

Negative
_Inspires guilt?
• Friend and Family Profile. Despite all of the questions in this chapter, none of this information will really hit home for you until you start working with it. It is easy to decide your character will, for instance, be greedy and suspicious. But that alone will not create him. It is just a small piece of the puzzle, and there remain thousands of other traits to consider. It can all seem
overwhelming.
The best instructor is life itself. Start with the people closest to you. Go through your list of traits and ask yourself which apply to a particular friend or family member. Write them down and see if you have captured the person, if by simply listing his traits you can accurately depict a person to someone who has never met him. Probably not. Something mysterious remains to complete the picture. This is what makes people people. What is it? What's missing? Whatever it is, add it. Consider what you've learned by the omission and how it might apply when it comes time to build other characters.
• Stranger profile. Family and friends are easy. Y>u know them. Now try meeting someone in a bar and setting them down on paper. Y>u will have to form instant impressions, observe everything in a short period of time. Eventually, you won't have to go over your list of traits—instead, you'll find that a person's defining traits jump out at you.
Show your profile to five people and ask them their impressions of this character from your description. You'll be disappointed to find that all five have differing opinions, and probably associate him with someone else. Also notice that traits which had seemed so clear to you in the person's presence became hard to capture on the page, to articulate to others. Capturing and presenting a character in such a way that others can have an equally vivid experience of the person is an art in and of itself. Observing is only half the battle.

This is your training as a writer. Y>u will improve on both fronts with practice.
• Defining Characteristics. Often when someone comes to mind, certain traits come instantly to mind with them. Consciously or not, you categorize
this person. If you had to choose your character's three dominating characteristics, what would they be? This exercise will leave you with only the barest
overview of your character; nevertheless, it is helpful—indeed, crucial—since it will tell you what first impression your character makes on others, and it is the first impression that often sticks. This will help you get an instant handle on him, and will be very helpful when you are
dealing with many characters,
especially when you need to keep in mind how many characters might interact with others (covered at length in Chapter Three).
• Evolution. Y>u should by now have a pretty good sense of who this person is, but keep in mind that you only know who this person is at this moment. People change, day to day, year to year— indeed, the very point of most works is to show such a change. So, especially if there a passage of time, you will have to check in with your character at different points in your work and ask if all of this still applies. For instance, your character's goals will be different at sixteen than at twenty-eight. Has he outgrown his ambition? Has he changed hobbies? Has he become charitable? Consider these three exercises:
1) Check in with his past. Who was he twenty-years ago? Ten years ago? Five years? One year? Six months? Last _Jealous? Covetous?
.Cheap?

—Insecure, easily threatened? __Low self-esteem? _Critical?
_Competitive? _Makes fun of people? _An egoist, vain? __Self-centered? _Talks over people? _Opinionated? _Impractical? _Unmotivated? _Unorganized?
_A follower? _Directionless? ___Undisciplined ? _Indulgent, wasteful? _Harsh, caustic? ___.Impatient? _Coward? __Unproductive? ___Small goals? _Afraid to take risks? _Immature?
_Overly serious? _Morbid, a downer? _Unhappy? _Complainer?

week? Was he a completely different person back then? Or has he remained exactly the same? (Both are telling.) How has he changed? Has he changed for the better or for the worse? For the better in some areas, for the worse in others? How does all of this affect who he is right now? For instance, say he is now a businessman, but ten years ago he was an actor—now you know he's not just an ordinary businessman, but one who perhaps still longs for involvement in the arts—or who perhaps has compensated by becoming hypercritical of them. Or say he's now a renowned food critic, but at one point in his life he was an Orthodox Jew. Taking his past identity into account, you now know that he's not just an ordinary food critic, but one who might feel guilt when he samples pork. How can all of this affect how you portray him on the page?
2) The Catalysts. Often it is specific events—not just the passage of time—that spark fundamental changes in a character. The death of a parent. The birth of a son. Marriage. Divorce. Jail. The new job. Reflect on who your character used to be and who he is now. When you think of how he is different, also think of what events may have occurred along the way to make him so. All of these catalysts hold tremendous potential for plot points. Y>u can use them in flashback sequences, or extract them from his past and place them in the present. In either case, they are crucial to know, even if you don't use them, and can be used as rough stepping-stones along the path of a character's past.
3) Check in with his future. What are his plans for next week? Next month? Next year? His five- year plan? Where does he see himself in ten years? Twenty? Even if he is not
a planner, he still must have some vague vision of where he's heading. Is he a bachelor who'd like to marry and have kids? A prisoner who wants to go straight? A suburban man who wants more excitement? Is his focus only on material gain? Change of circumstance? Or is his focus on evolving as a person? Educating himself? Becoming more spiritual? Why does he want such a change? What does he hope to gain? How will his life change once he has it? What is he waiting for? What obstacles stand in his way? Y>u now have a good handle not only on who he is, but on who he wants to become. This, inherently, will help create tension, since there is now a mission, a path. Even if he doesn't get what he wants, that, too, will be interesting, since we get to watch the difference between his imagined life and his real one, between anticipation and reality.
• Identity. How would your character respond to the question: "What do you do?" How closely intertwined will his answer be with how he sees himself as a person? How would your character respond to the more profound question: "Who are you?" Would he even be able to answer? How would this answer differ from his answer to, "What do you do?" Is there a discrepancy? How much of his identity is wrapped up in his career?
• Outer and Inner Life Discrepancy. As you conclude these first two chapters, you will have a good handle both on your character's outer and inner life. How big a discrepancy is there between the two? Or is there none at all? Does he put on a totally different face for the outside world? Or does he wear his entire life on his sleeve? Is his outer life misleading?
Is he an establishmentarian who secretly does drugs? The perfect husband who has affairs? The man with a long rap sheet who is secretly innocent and is, in fact, a great humanitarian? How will your character appear to others in the work? How does he act to his boss as opposed to his son, his friend, his wife? Is there a divergence in his behavior toward these different people? Might a teenager be relaxed and vulgar with his friends but somber and restrained with his parents? Might a father be easygoing with his wife but strict with his children? Which is the real him? Will other characters ever get past the veneer?
• From Inner Character Traits to Plot Points. This exercise is the same exercise that can be found at the end of Chapter One, except this one focuses on the character traits covered in Chapter Two—the character's inner life. Go through each topic covered—abilities, religion, spirituality, identity, beliefs, programs, ethics, sex, motivation, friendships, conversational focus, self-awareness, values, allocation of time, artistic impulse, heroes, politics and ideology, relationship to authority, vices, time line, relationship to food, habits, quirks, hobbies, charity, and personality—and ask yourself how any one of these characters traits might influence the plot. For instance, looking at the category of innate abilities, we might ask, does he have the innate ability of a master pianist? (Amadeus) Is she
psychic? {The Gift) Is he slow? (Sling Blade)
• The Unnameable. The questions in these two chapters were crucial in that they got you thinking about aspects of your characters you may not have previously considered.
However, this is not to say that these questions are the final word, or that they can substitute for real life. They cannot. Real life is the best teacher.
I dislike the hackneyed phrase "Write what you know," since it implies you must "know" everything in order to write. That is not the case; some of the most famously realistic works were composed in complete isolation, by authors who had never set foot in the setting of their works and had no experience with the "real-life subject" of their work. Still, while you needn't necessarily "know" in order to write, it is often extraordinarily helpful to base your characters at least partially on real-life people. The point here isn't necessarily to capture reality but to aid your imagination by complementing it with real life—which is always a more complex, vivid, and unexpected tapestry than we could ever possibly imagine.
Having exhausted your lists of inner and outer character traits, go out and interact with people in real life. No matter how thorough you thought you'd been in advance, you'll find that some previously
indistinguishable trait jumps out at you. What is it? Take it and run with it. That is your foundation. Like the electricity bolt that brings Frankenstein's monster to life, that is what will infuse life into your character.
