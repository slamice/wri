Facial Looks:

Big, (crooked? broken?) nose, an arab nose
Brown eyes
Thick eyebrows
A light beard because he's too lazy to shave most of the time
Olive colored skin
Looks 'cute', not neccessarily good looking
hands are dry and itchy in the winter. They bleed from eczema.
Hair is kept in a fashionable cut, something that cost him close to 50 dollars. It's borderline hipster.


Body looks:

He's 6', skinny build. Broad shoulders but skinny legs.
He's 26, lookign like a teenager with a light beard.

Clothes:
- Wears mostly skinny jeans, ripped, with some designer shoes or sweater but not too obvious. He can afford them.
- Clothe sare in trend for the scene.
- When he goes to work he wears his light v-neck sweater and black pants.


Beliefs:
- He's into how he looks, fashionable and a bit vain.
- He doesn't feel confident, and is stuck in a bizarre routine but is afraid of the alternatives. He doesn't want a company job and he doesn't want to be a bum.
- He is vaguely muslim and doesn't pray much. He wants to be more Zen, perhaps with meditation, but realizes he can't because he has to live in this world.
- Trying to determine his direction.
