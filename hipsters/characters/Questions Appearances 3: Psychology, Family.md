Family Background

Was he raised by both parents? If not, why? Were they divorced? Was one deceased? How old was he when either of these things happened? If he wasn't raised by both parents, was he raised by his mother or his father? Or did he alternate between them? How much time did he spend with each? Did he live in different homes? Did they live close by? Or, was he raised by another relative (grandparent, uncle)? Was he raised by a homosexual couple (two fathers, two mothers)? Was he adopted? If his parents divorced, did either remarry? Does he have a stepparent?

What did his parents do for a living? How did that affect his upbringing? Are his parents still alive? How old are they? Is he close to them? How often do they talk? How much of an influence have they had on his life?
Does he have grandparents? Did they live close by? Did they have a big influence on his life? Are they still alive?
How many siblings does he have, if any? Being an only child could be a crucial aspect of a character's makeup, as could his having six siblings. Brothers or sisters? Has having five brothers

made him more feminine? Is he the oldest, youngest, or middle child? How does this affect him? Has being the oldest
made him more protective, paternal? Has being the youngest made him pampered, spoiled? How old are the siblings? Is he close to them? In competition with them? How often does he see them? Do they live close by? How big a role do they play in his life?
Is he married? At what age? For how long? How did they meet? Did they come together despite the odds? Is he happy? Is she? Are they equal as a couple, or are there discrepancies between them (in age, wealth, status, education, religion)? Are they able to overcome these discrepancies, or are they driving them apart? Do they fight? How often? What are their common interests (if any)? Where do they dissent? Do they treat the kids differently? Do they work together? Do they play a pivotal part in each other's lives? Or do they live in separate homes? Do they have a prenuptial agreement? Is either having an affair? With whom? For how long? Does the other know?
Does his wife have a large family? How do they get along? How big a part do they play in his life? Are his siblings married? How does he get along with his brother's wife? His sister's husband? How has marriage changed family dynamics? Do
his siblings have children? How does he get along with their kids? Is he a good uncle? Are they all close?
Now apply these questions to the character(s) in your work. What details might you incorporate that you may not have thought of previously?

Imagine you work for an adoption agency, and a woman has just come through the door who wants to adopt an infant. Y)u need to find out everything you possibly can about her current children (if any), fertility, and motives for adopting. What sort of questions might you ask?
If childless, does she plan on having children? Is she unable to get pregnant? Has she spent years visiting fertility clinics, to no avail? Is she on birth control? Did she have a permanent operation? Does she regret that? Does she worry about her biological clock?
If she has children, how many does she have? How many would she like? Or are these more than she wanted to begin with? Did she get pregnant by the first boy she slept with? Were her pregnancies rough? Her deliveries? Did she have any abortions? Lose any babies? Are they all hers by birth, or are some adopted, or some from another marriage? Does she resent them for it?
How old are her children? What are their names? Were they named after any relatives? How close is she to them? Do they cause her grief? Or do they bring her honor? Is she in competition with them? Are they attending the same colleges she did? How much of herself does she see in them? Does she consider herself a good parent? Do the kids? How does she treat her kids? Is she abusive? Has she ever hit them? Or is she abused by them? Do they listen to her? Does she listen to them? Does she live vicariously through them? What sacrifices has she made for them? Does she have grandchildren? Is she active in their lives?
Now apply these questions to the character(s) in your work. What details might you incorporate that you may not have thought of previously?
If you were to ask your character to analyze herself, would there be a discrepancy? Does she consider herself good to the kids while she hits them?
The Employer
Imagine you run a company and are responsible for hiring new employees. A critical position has just been vacated, and a candidate sits before you. The future of your company might lie in his skills and abilities. He is a complete stranger. What might you ask him?
