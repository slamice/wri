Renee and I strolled angrily towards our apartment in silence. As we crossed the large parking lot though Renee changed her expression, Dock was coming back towards them. "Hi Dock, how's it going?" He smiled and waved back, but then stopped suddenly in front of us with a jerky jerk.

Dock suddenly turned withered, depleted, a bit drunk and angry. He decomposed in front of them rapidly like a drying leaf. "I talked to Gabby, do you remember my ex-girlfriend?" he yelled at the top of his lungs, "and FOUR years ago, FOUR YEARS AGO, you took what was mine." He body flailed and shook. Dock pointed his finger hard at him. "She asked you for a letter, a fucking letter. They sent it to ME, do you fucking remember?!"

Renee's eyes were wide open and the pair were both thoroughly confused. He barely remembered Gaby. Girly, thick accented, lost looks in her eyes. Dock woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you." She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

I tried to think back, four years ago. Visiting Dock's house at that time was very uneventful. Dock used to live in a house off campus with a few randoms. Equipped with two floors and a basement, it felt massive. He remembered the kitchen. Fruit flies swam endlessly in circles over the sink, milk jugs in the fridge with just a bit of rotting milk skimming the bottom. One had a neglected pug they were always furious at. Because it shat on their beds whenever it could.

He thought for a moment, "No, I don't th--"

"LIAR!" He screamed at the top of his lungs, "YOU are A FUCKING LIAR! You're an awful fucking person. You remember she ASKED YOU? You came to my house and she ASKED you to take it. She TOLD ME." He started to tense up, and Renee stepped back.

"I really don't remember, this was four years ago? Did something happen abou-"

"THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT ASSHOLE, You fucking took that letter from ME, from MY ROOM. YOU INVADED MY PRIVACY, YOU FUCK."

"Dock calm down!" Renee yelled, now concerned, queerly intent on what looked like teh beginning of a fight. A vein or two appeared on Dock's neck and/or forehead. Whatever.

"Wait, what was this for? What is this letter?"

"It was her visa so she could stay in the country." Dock hissed.

He tried really hard to remember what he did, and suddenly manifested in his mind an image of him grabbing something from the top of a pile of papers. He remembered the request now from Gaby. He remembered he found it odd because she never asked anything of him. The only thing that bound them together was their flakey friends.

"Dock, oh my God I'm sorry, I didn't even think about it, I'm so sorry. But she needed that to stay in the country, no? Were you even dating her th-"

"You violated my privacy," Dock steamed, very pale. "You dented my blood. I was going to use that letter to confront her. BUt you fucked that up. You fucking asshole, I will NEVER forgive you. You CROSSED ME." And Dock charged at him, throwing a punch in his stomach. It wasn't hard, but the shock was. He felt violated somehow. Dock walked right through him and didn't look back.

"What the hell Dock?!" Renee shrieked, but Dock kept going. He took a step back and tried to understand if he was hurt. At that moment his temper shot up like Renee's ex, and he bellow a scream. "You idiot?! You think you got some kind of revenge? Over some kind of stupid plan you- FOUR YEARS AGO?! You moron! I apologized and you still hit me!"

But dock marched on, standing up taller now, shoulders straight. Dock slowly faded, saying nothing.

"Do you feel good now?! You feel you won something? You coward! Come back and fight this stupid fight like a real man you idiot! ANGUS!" Renee told him to shut up. Dock turned a corner and escaped from hmm. Renee whispered, "You know, you deserve that."

A second shock overcame me, "What?!" I shot her a hard look, but it couldn't penetrate anything.

"You know why. He's right, he's bad but a better person than you. You're wrong about so many things but you just don't see it. You're not a nice guy, you need to know that." Her words stood in the air, dancing and stomping hard on my head, then crashed a car into it, sending it hurtling off a cliff. In angry awe I mulled these words over in my mouth like a baby's challenge and finally started to care enough to hate her.

"Are you for real?! Is this real life? Do you understand what just fucking happened here?! Do you _understand_?"

"PERFECTLY. EVERYTHING IS CLEAR. Look at me, I've overcome so much. He's right." And suddenly she marched home in what I only assumed was frustration. I stood there in shock.

"COME _ON_" She ushered, "COME the fuck _ON_. Let's go _home_."
