Handed a plastic (flower) Leigh, I stepped aboard the yacht like a sinner. A bit cautious, perhaps overly so, but one can never be too sure can they? What are cruises to people.

The older men and women had tattoos covering their biceps and thighs, tired of the idle chatter strategy. Their expressions and the colour in their faces both ran, drained from conversing a life of tans and cocktails. The tiny younger crowd were vivid, giggling but unsure. They wrestled with basic facts, looking out over at the city and neighborhood waters. They saw the buildings sip the sky and their plastic alcohol cups sip them. There was a bit more to it but I wasn't paying attention.

A very tan woman turned towards me who looked like someone I barely worked with. She wore a flower dress, the only one prepared to feign for the occasion. She talked about her life, her trip to Puerto Rico, her fame as an athletics event organizer at a local gym years back. She cut our conversation short when a bulky French arm tattooed with a Mohican and a few snakes approached her. Out of the scene now, thoroughly blurred, I went past them unobserved.

The ship ebbed towards the ocean, towards a few islands we were set out to discover superficially. People snapped photos and looked pretty, vacant. It wasn't awkward so much as it was limiting. Past the pineapple sandwiches and fruit rice, once the tiny paper umbrellas unfolded and the rum soaked brownies flowed, people opened up. The bartender popped his collar and gave me an endless flow of cranberry apple juice.

I discovered two girls from Tallahassee working as designers at an auto shop company. The heavily tattooed developer from Texas who shunned beef after growing up on a pig farm. The two African event coordinators who together came upon a nude beach by accident. Besides a shallow description, I didn't find out any other details about their jobs. Even the invitees were seldom found, checking in with people to make sure they were still on the boat. They didn't seem important anyway. The ship's aimless bobbing to no goal took all our attention and ground it to dust.

An Italian and Jewish pair were huddled in one corner of the boat, discussing their ex boyfriends, their ex boyfriend's dogs and architecture.

"This building is really tall but has those empty floors in the middle. It's earthquake proof right now. That's actually earthquakePROOF"

"Who built it?"

"A Russian architect" she whimpered, "Don't ask me how I know."

The Italian girl chattered away a reply at full force, the other sipped through a straw, looking around aimlessly. It was impossible to tell how much drugs were involved in her demeanour. Perhaps none.

"Are you Italian? I'm Italian." She stared. The sun went down and besides her eyes it got too dark to tell her expression.

"No" I yelled over the growing drunken people and waves. "Do you think I would fit in better if I did?" The Jewish girl flit her head up suddenly like a bird, and then away.

"I don't know I don't exactly fit it, like I'm not married yet all my family is married I work at a big company and lots of people just bail on you... During work too, people don't even notice. My whole department, you know," pause, a comment towards the bird "I mean did you see Tony? I've been working past eight all week and he's said nothing. I don't really get how he even has his job. The other day, see... He's never filled out Jonas's accountant forms WE ALL did can you believe _that_?"

Her friend shook her head "No, I can't".

The ship shrugged and swung in slow motion back to the docks. Patrons became excited, lively, bored, full, happy, tipsy, celebrating, a tiny bit seasick. A few final pictures took in the city lights. The pier welcomed them comely, giving in to their now witless and non-existent drunk charms.

Docked, everyone escaped in a different direction for blocks on end. No one knew anyone anymore except those they came with. I walked home alone, pondering nothing with my legs wandering. I walked twenty blocks and past garbage after building after loiterers. The city lazily blinked as I got on the metro platform heading to my apartment.

While waiting, I turned around and the Jewish bird smiled at him, head a bit crooked. I what the fuck jumped, startled.

"Ah you live a few up?" She stumbled a bit as if she was still holding a drink.

"Barely, did you like the boat?" I asked, a bit coy.

"Yea well, you know it wasn't bad. It was good it was good."

"Did you like the people?"

She took a pause, ignoring me, and stuttered, "Th-there were a few of those, yea."

I thought for a bit, "I mean there were some that were just, I don't know, like, 'in general' people. But there are always a few gems." And I gestured to her, accidentally without thinking. Immediately embarrassed.

We rode the train with a few other direly bored riders. Like everyone in the city they looked like they had an experience, like they were shaken or beaten up. All of them were doing laundry, wearing the shirt they wear on the day they do laundry. I threw a few glances at the crowd, threw a few words back at the bird.

"I didn't talk too much. You werked a... Sha-me technologies? SHA-ke? Ma-ke?" She pronounced slowly, stuttering, wavering like a rag on a rustled laundry line (clothespin).

"Make, yea. But no, remember that. Shake technologies, it's better. Are you alright?"

She smiled wearily, "Yea I'm going to my brother's this weekend."

She got off at her stop and chucked a goodbye in the train just before the doors closed, and wobbled up the stairs.
