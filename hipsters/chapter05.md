We hibernated in this city. I felt lazy and slow, floating from coffee shop to sushi shop day in and day out. Renee called me often whining she'd rather stay in than go out. I read a few novels quietly soaking in imaginary lives.

So I welcomed the frequent concerts Selina and I tagged along too. Usually we'd head to Headless Burritos afterwards ordering tightly tin foiled pockets of cheese and beans. A weak white pillar to devour. Usually many people after a concert heavily patted each other on our backs and heads on our bands and where we're set to go. This was basically heavy petting.

One night after a noise rock show Selina and I sat silently watching people revolve in and out, a vegan bean wrap in one hand and a coconut water in the other.

"Playing in an alleyway was kind of cool." Selina said between bites. I sat still waiting for my food, hungry and distant.

"They're pretty lucky to have a place at all." I sputtered. A mop of curly hair and tattered clothes brought in her bike and ordered two smoked tofu burrits. Two people behind us smacked their food and conversation. One tried to explain how girls were attracted to tighter clothes, specifically sweaters. The other sang "fricking ay, man, fricking ay." between sentences.

My food finally arrived humbly and I ate it mindlessly.

"What are we doing Selina?" I looked at her. She stared back at me like a smiling ghost, as pale as one. Her glasses were huge.

"We're having the burrits."

"We need to go on that tour. It's no joke. We need that tour. Even if we only travelled a week... I'd take it."

"It'd be longer than that anyway. They're going to Portland, have you ever been there?"

"I haven't been anywhere really."




Fairly later, our company's gym sponsored a cruise once a year. Its' hopes were to spin some people around the rivers while pitching their guests to join a year long contract to sweat, hoping they just pay and don't actually show up.
