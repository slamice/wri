Ch5. Om works and takes up cruise. He argues with his dad on coming back. His job calls him in for lack of attention to detail. Om can't admit his heart is not in his work, but thinks about the fancy hipster barbers, the coffee shop lackeys and the freelance graphic designers, so he holds back on quitting.


The office shrunk over the next few weeks. The company lost a major deal in the millions they were counting on. They fired a few extra developers, but not me because my pay was so low. I had no investment in the company, and it only smiled at me everyday like a manager smiles at you when they say hi in the bathroom, or in the hall, or on your awkward quiet way down the elevator.

Michael and I caught up at lunch. He enjoyed sports so much he only talked about them through all our lunches, even though I knew none of the people nor the rules of any game he enjoyed. He was such an exhuberent talker and I was such an exhuberent nodder we entertained each other every time.

"There's a company cruise coming up." a sentence I was suddenly related to cleared up, "apparently enough people go to the new york gym they want the rest of us to join."

"So they gather all of us to solicit on the boat?"

"Yea I guess the yearly memberships are drying up again. I'm not surprised, people pay so much for these gyms but rarely go. I hear huge gyms' turnover rates are around fifty percent."

"You want to go?"

"I might. But I don't know how many people I'm ready to fight off to get drunk on their boat."

"I don't know free anything sounds alright to me. But you're right it could be a joke."

Michel shrugged "The joke is on them honestly. We've already all been through years of signing up and just staying at home after a few weeks."

Lunch is always almost over.

We hibernated in this city. I felt lazy and slow, floating from coffee shop to sushi shop day in and day out. Renee called me often whining she'd rather stay in than go out. I read a few novels quietly soaking in imaginary lives.

So I welcomed the frequent concerts Selina and I tagged along to and played. Usually we'd head to Headless Burritos afterwards ordering tightly tin foiled pockets of cheese and beans. A weak white pillar to devour. After a concert there was a lot of heavy petting on backs and heads. Good jobs and great sound, regardless of the noise and genre.

One night after a noise rock show Selina and I sat silently in our common burrito shop, watching people revolve in and out. For each customer a vegan bean wrap in one hand and a coconut water in the other.

"Playing in an alleyway was kind of cool." Selina sputtered. I sat still waiting for my food, hangry and distant.

"They're pretty lucky to have a place at all."

A mop of curly hair and tattered clothes brought in her bike and ordered two smoked tofu burrits. Two people behind us smacked their food and conversation. One tried to explain how girls were attracted to tighter clothes, specifically sweaters. The other sputtered "fricking ay, man, fricking ay." between sentences.

My food finally arrived, humbly placed before me by a tattoo sleeve. It went down mindlessly.



--------------- Try to make conversation a but more awkward and more silence to show the relationship between the father and Om better. -------------------



"What are we doing Selina?" I looked at her. She stared back at me like a smiling ghost, as pale as one. Her glasses were huge.

"We're having the burrits."

"We need to go on that tour. It's no joke. We need that tour. Even if we only travelled a week... I'd take it."

"It'd be longer than that anyway. They're going to P_______, have you ever been there? I haven't been anywhere really."

On our way back my phone hummed. "Hello?"

"Hey big guy! How are you?"

"I'm doing alright Dad."

"How's the job?"

"It's going ok, you know it's going. How are you?"

"I'm doing good, your Mom has problems."

"What happened to Mom?" I hastened a wave goodbye to Selina as a shock enveloped me.

"Oh she just depressed about some things, I don't know what to do with her. Always try to make her happy. She's fine, don't worry though. When are you coming to visit son?"

"I told you Dad I can't come back without the visa."

"When do you think you'll have it?"

"I'm not sure honestly, some time soon I hope. I check my mail everyday."

"You said that last time, we just haven't seen you in forever."

"I told you," I said sighing, "You can come here anytime."

A shuffling then a pause, "Well son for everyone to come it's not possible. Anyway, your brothers will be here in May so if you can make it please come."

I leaned on a wall commanding to "POST NO BILLS". "If anything changes I'll come as soon as possible."

"Ok good."

"Is Mom ok?"

"Yes she's fine. No problem. I'm just talking son. Did you reach the next level at your job, son? When are you going to be the manager? Are you managing people?"

"The next level? No not yet."

"Ok well please do son. You know it's what's best for your future. I'm only giving advice and my opinion, but it's for your future."

"I know Dad."

"Ok well son I'm going to go. Say hi to what's her name? The french one?"

"Renee. Yes I'll say hi to her."

"Ok great. Have a good day son. Ok Bye."

"Bye Dad."

Fairly later, our company's gym sponsored a cruise once a year. Its' hopes were to spin some people around the rivers while pitching their guests to join a year long contract to sweat, hoping they just pay and don't actually show up.
