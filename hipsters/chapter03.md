Sometimes I skipped the train. The most memorable moments I had, honestly, were ones of walking home. After throwing away work, adding more work, shuffling work, I threw a few goodbyes back as I walked out the door. Everyone rushed and stood cramped in subway cars underneath me, all buried together, while I walked above them, free, with air. It was usually brisk, clean walks.

In some areas the streets were empty. Alley after alley was empty save bits of trash. But you'd look closer, and a glimpse from an apartment window or a woman walking her dog, felt like it had some life but the rest of the people there were driven out quite a while ago.

It was pretty silent in the apartment mostly.
