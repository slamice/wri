*TODO* Possibly time has passed from seeing Jack, explain how they are flaky and barely talk to each other anyway? Or that they slowly have been growing apart since college because narrator Om is losing interest?


Ch3 . Renee is still connected with his old friends. Eventually they go to jack's place. The point of this chapter is to develop the story behind Renee and her self victimization, also Om's growing ambivalence and hate for his social circle.












Renee and I were walking back to our makeshift apartment when we saw a light was on ahead of us. Since we moved in we haven't visited Jack and his friends. I hadn't seen him since the dance party. He lived with Andy and Prof. If you're wondering then yes, Prof is not his real name. He had one that was slightly more embarassing but fairly uninteresting.

"We should at least stop by to visit them."

"I mean maybe Jack but that's it. Just _avoid_ Andrew. Why am I supposed to see him?"

"Because he's still my friend-" she said, stammering.

"He used to beat you." I said sharply, "I just don't understand why you'd want anything to do with him."

"Yea but that's old ages ago. I mean he used to get really mad but he's getting in a better place. He's moving to a BETTER PLACE in his life. Can't you see that?"

We walked underneath their window and before another comment Renee yelled up for Andrew. From the second floor Jack's sleepy face poked out, and sleepier voice yelled down "Yeah he's here. Come up!". Jack's girlfriend, squirrelly Sarah came down to open the door, her hair a bushel and her front teeth just slightly bucked.

Andy's apartment was a desolate. It was a single huge room he lived in with Jack and Prof. Each of the three bedrooms were quarantined off with shower curtains. The ceiling was low. Anyone taller than 6 feet could only stand upright in the very middle of the apartment under one of two windows, the skylight. It was a bit hard to imagine the place designed for anything but a mess. Littered on the floor were Prof's coffee mugs and cappuccino cups. Jack's paints were next to them with beer bottles, cigarette trays complete with ash, nails and chipped wood. Signs of Andrew were everywhere but his main manifest was a pile of books. The lighting, as with all of the lighting within the industrial area, was a depressing florescent.

There was barely a kitchen thrown off to the side. Someone tossed a lopsided fridge in a corner. A cutting board sat on the counter with a cleaver sticking straight up out of it. "For cutting cheese," Sarah whispered when she caught me glimpse at it. The inhabitants loafed around unapologetically, eyes a tad hazy.

There was art. Jack's work lined the walls and floor underneath. Lots of paintings. A desert with a naked woman standing by a cactus, a mesh of naked women spewing out of a drain. A pair of boobs floating in the sky. Different chairs were painted various hues, one had a tv glued to its seat with a portrait of a seagull. These things came to Jack casually, painted with pastels and cigarette smoke. I hadn't seen Jack's latest art in a while. 

"Which one do you like?" Jack rubbed his nose.

"Where do your ideas come from?" I asked.

"Sometimes in my sleep, sometimes they creep up on me. Sometimes they come to me like a locomotive." proud of remembering something he considered archaic to use.

"I like this one", his girlfriend Sarah yawned out a whine. She pointed to a painting with a woman wearing no pants, in fact nothing but a tiny t-shirt that said "NO cooking". She rode a horse into space.

Jack also covered the walls in masses of text and melting heads. Quotes from Burroughs and Ginsberg were scribbled, smeared and softened. Some of the text was attached to torsos and huge brains that looked suspended in midair. It's as if someone sipped some ink and spat on the walls repeatedly. Pollack chewing, drooling tobacco in disgust, rubbing his face in it. "Irregular atmosphere, timid and reluctant" was written in one corner. "Art space for drunks" was written in another.

Behind us Prof's shadow danced loudly against one of the curtains as he rummaged through a box of tools.

Andrew sat on the floor, rolling a joint on a crate. He licked his fingers and pressed them against the thin paper. His sockets were deep in his face, naturally born that way. He always looked either sad, indifferent or angry. Renee explained previously that he probably always felt like he was missing something and never found it. That something was probably his unborn twin, dead in the womb. He could never forget the memories he never had with his brother. His parents were worried he'd go through the rest of his life with regret. It certainly looked like they were winning their bet.

"So what are you doing these days Andy?" Renee asked him cheerfully.

Andrew rolled the joint between his fingers, responding casually without looking up at her, "I'm working up at Cuppa Joe, also working on the film script with Ethan and Marley. We're sharing some of the dialogue and there's a big funeral scene with a eulogy. That's all I can say really."

He was obviously very uncomfortable. The marijuana smoke trailed up and swirled above his head in a halo. He took a sip and then handed it over to Jack. Sarah turned it down, but watched attentively.

"That's exciting!" Renee said with a huge grin, overemphatically "I'm super happy for you! A movie, it really sounds like you're going places Andy!"

"Jack's in it too actually. He got a part as the protagonist's friends." Jack nodded in agreement. Sarah stared at Jack then off into space.

"Oh really?!" Renee squealed. "I didn't know they'd invite so many people on this, they were pretty secretive about it."

I wondered about what the movie was about. I didn't know much about Ethan and Marley but I met them a few times when they picked Renee up. She knew them through practiced ayahuasca once a month in a forest. They puked the whole night together, calling it purging. Marley painted pictures of flowers and giggled every other word. Ethan was involved in two huge children's productions that made them well off for a while. They both wrote scripts for hollywood that couldn't make it past the noses of producers. But this time it was their movie, probably about something holistic and etherial like Super Yoga.

Jack muttered in, "Yea they had auditions and yeeeeaaaa I can do that." but then he turned his attention to me, "Long time no see, so how's it going?" he patted me on the back, "How've you been, are you still working at the, what... The software thing? place?"

"Yea I'm still there."

"Well do you like it?" Sarah feigned interest.

"Yea it's alright, I don't know. I don't really like everything about my work."

"But is it FUN?" Jack looked at me. I was a bit surprised at how serious his tone was suddenly.

"Yea it's ok, I like programming I guess." I tried not to look at Andy. His presence made me uncomfortable, in fact the whole situation did.

"I guess you can make a lot of good money but it's pretty menial work. I talked to Matt, he's not too into it." and then Jack went on and on.

Jack must have felt the weird tension? How often did this situation occur, lovers of the past and present fight it out with passive aggressive blows. Probably fairly often but still. Andy and I hadn't talked in months. Our last conversation, typical of Andy, was how the universe was expanding but could barely accommodate anyone even though the people in it were dying. Andy knew I was Renee's latest best friend supposably. We hadn't talked since. Now Andy was sullen, apathetic at first glance, nothing unusual. But I'm sure it *dug* deep into him.

In the corner were a few Kerouac novels Jack was fond of. Next to those were records piled on the ground. Glancing at the titles, they were mostly 80's new wave or early 90's American noise rock. Their jackets were worn and tired. I started to leaf through the records to feel busy.

Renee was talking with Andy excitedly again about nothing in particular, in this case her mother.

"She's still there in her house. Do you remember when you snuck in to wait for me?"

"Yea, I remember her look."

"I never heard this. So what happened he broke in?" Jack intevened. Then I thought I saw Renee give Andy a potential flirt, maybe not living up to its fullest but it was definitely made available. I sat there questioning its authenticity when she answered.

"He climbed in through the window because he thought I was asleep but I was out then (doing what?). So he waited in the bathtub because he was ridiculous, not expecting my Mom to come back that weekend and walk through the door. I think she was at some kind of 'start your business' seminar."

"She didn't like it." Andy's voice crept back in on top of Renee's.

"You were crazy for doing that! You were crazy. She was pretty crazy too. I'm sure I told I used to wait for her for hours after school for her to pick me up. They worried about me then. She was always running errands."




How he could use a new type of herbal medication. How she's woken up sick with a rash on her face down to her arm, bed struck and unable to go work. Prof brooded in the shadows not saying anything, and I could see a silhouette putting on some black blurry headphones.

I didn't understand the meaning and didn't have a good idea of why I was there. What was floating in the atmosphere then? Sarcasm, grief, irony? The art slunked up against the walls undeterred by its inhabitants. I felt I was pretty small here. Even with the art, the flex-rooms, the smoke, dust, dirt and the people, the room still felt so empty. If you winked you weren't sure they were there. Like nothing was sure to exist in this space.

After about twenty minutes of this, I signaled to Renee I was leaving. She waved that she'd catch up with me in a few minutes, but got up anyway. I took a quick last look at Andy. He noticed, got up in fact, and in front of us all he looked me in the eye and said, "I forgive you" smiling, and shook my hand. His sockets were sunk like battleships. I shook back blandly and headed towards the stairs, ignoring the glances.

"You can come back and visit." Jack sleepily waved. The rest of the goodbyes procrastinated until we were out the door.

"Andy's changed! He's got a job and his life is getting stable. He's doing better," Renee was excited, almost blushing.

"Why do you care about someone who beat you?"

"He's a part of my life. You have to accept that. I've known him for so long."

And she tried to bring me back, "Hey! Come on! Don't worry of course I still love you. I'm with _you_ now! Come on!" I made a shut up smile. We walked back slowly in silence to the limo office, the only sound were Renee's inner thighs rubbing against each other wearing down her jeans.

The receptionist, also limo dispatcher, was there. Behind that counter was a huge grin, a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She now hobbled busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone 3000km away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight. She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" She laughed hard. I picked through the letters. Renee took her phone bill and some sales flyers unabashed.

Another week, no notices. The government shrugged and said nothing. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me.

We opened the apartment door. We were greeted by Renee's cat hurling puddles of hiss and screams in our faces. The utter joy.
