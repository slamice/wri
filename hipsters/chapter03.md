Sometimes I skipped the train. The most memorable moments I had, honestly, were ones of walking home. After throwing away work, adding more work, shuffling work, I threw a few goodbyes back as I walked out the door. Everyone rushed and stood cramped in subway cars underneath me, all buried together, while I walked above them, free, with air. It was usually brisk, clean walks.

In some areas the streets were empty. Alley after alley was empty save bits of trash. But you'd look closer, and a glimpse from an apartment window or a woman walking her dog, felt like it had some life but the rest of the people there were driven out quite a while ago.

It was pretty silent in the apartment mostly.

The party turned me off, and I began declining to go to them. Over the course of a few months I slowly started resisting to go out with anyone except band practice with Selina and a few shows sprinkled between them. Work was a chore. I booked it reasonably every chance I got. It was pretty easy with Renee, she barely made it out to dinners with her friends. The nights we stayed home I cooked, always an inviting challenge to cook a dinner with only four ingredients with no spices and somehow make it flavorful.

That apartment grew smaller. I don't remember too much from those days. I guess it was more about _what_ I remembered those days.

I remember my mother's yogurt soup and Khash. The bread carts. The countless electrical wires above the streets. All the skirmishes. My dad, constantly on the phone. The instability. The made up girls. The phone glued to his head. My brother and sister shouting at each other. The final move to Canada. My final move to the US.

I'm still waiting for those papers.




Before I knew it I missed the few months I brushed off, as usual. Not because they meant something, but because I wasted them.
