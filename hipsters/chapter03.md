Ch3. Time drags on. He shuffles his feet, wondering how he got here. He recalls his family, how his mother hated Lebanon and how his father loved it. Also how his brothers were there. Then moved him happily overseas. The feeling he gets when he arrives at college is freedom, and he begins drinking. He meets Ryan in his dorm.

Om feels disengaged and tired. The point of the chapter is to show how Om has whittled down. Apart from band practice and work, he stays home. He goes to bed earlier but wakes up the same time everyday. He hates thinking about the past but does it anyway. He remembers his silent parents. He recalls how much he hated highschool. He feels lonely. Selina is in the area and he meets up with her once. Coffee cup scene.

------------

It was like any gentrified neighborhood I guess. Renee barely showed up to anything back then.

She spent most of her time being absent. Be it the drugs she took or the demeanor she appeared to have by not appearing. There was some kind of mystery going on, an incredibly attractive one I was a tiny bit hopeless to find out about.

-------------


About then I had a reoccurring dream, one you've probably had. There was a cliff, and it didn't matter if the push from my parents or from ancient bullies, but it all happened

---------

I landed myself in a university far from my parents, or at least far enough to forget about hating them. My feelings about them fluctuated between pounding on things and thankfully being sent here alone as soon as they left after helping me move in.

Parties on campus were brutally exhausting without something substantial to dull me. Weed was usually the norm but light drinking was another option I took up. I never overindulged, but inhaled just enough to feel like they was working.












Selina called me up for a coffee headache that night. "Hello fellow human!" She cheerfully gleed at me through the phone.

Selina didn't think "you guys" made any feministic sense, so she opted for "Hello kindly people" and "Greetings fellow homosapiens."

My pace was relentlessly slow because I knew I'd be late. The buildings around me didn't exist as I stared at the ground or nothing.

I lifted a penny off the world and put the grimy thing in my pocket. This was money on the ground, pure value. Over the years I made quite a heap. Probably around sixty dollars. The change was all in a small jar. I never really felt I needed it though.

It was late but the dark cafe was pretty active with many designers and artists slumped over tables and couches. Some yawned out conversations, others whooped mildly as they played risk in corners.

Selina's eyes were at half mast with a very visible hazy red in their corners "I got high with Jeremy tonight." She gleamed.

"How's that going?" I concerned as bitterly as my gingerbread coffee.

"I don't know, what do you think of him?"

"I don't know him."

"He's a good guy, you'd like him." Every other word from Selina was lightly hurkled with a distant tired smile. "He's a university radio station coordinator. His friend works at Happy Blue Cat so we got to watch so many old documentaries. Rare ones about doctors in the sixties and bikes."

"Like stunt bikes?"

"All kinds of bikes. Hmm." And then, "Are you alright?"

"I'm totally fine. Absolutely nothing happened."

"How's Renee? She never comes out."

"Yea she's not feeling too well tonight."

"Oh what's wrong?"

"Well we don't know exactly but her mono is acting up again." I shifted in my seat uncomfortably. Our conversation breaks were laggy but not substantial.

I pushed the envelope and the coffee mug against my cheek.

"What are you doing?"

"It keeps me warm. Warm cheekies. I don't even like coffee."

An eyebrow raised on her face, "then why order coffee then?"

"A latte is thicker so it'll keep me warmer."








































The weather was much hotter in L______ because, I don't know it felt humid. We lived in Lebanon until my mom couldn't take it anymore. The traffic, the noise, the exhaust. Sometimes I thought my mother's eyebrow was permanently raised, disavowing all belief in pure chaos. The country didn't feel like it functioned, but moved like a wheel moves. Because it had to.

Until we moved to Canada. My brother, sister and I sighed relief into a vacant apartment.

My father's ear was glued to the phone. During an argument, during the seven day war, during a meal, in bed, even now. The phone was in his pocket twisted and insulted from all the shouting it endured.






The weather sucked. On what exactly wasn't important. There's a whole hidden season people choose to ignore. Its' heavy with musk and wet and dreary. Routines become slogs and everyone feels it. My energy drained, my ambitions shot then. Often around times that I wondered if there was a tear in me. Usually the pain of it disappeared and I could feel like a normal person. around the is season though it howled, mostly in the mornings. It stung and I'd feel the gash all around me, bleeding into the world.







------------

Most of the time the buildings don't exist. They disappear and the slow traffic and indifferent expressions toss me a few thoughts to juggle. They hit my face and stick for a bit then fall to the sidewalk.

My family

There's always a neglected penny everywhere. You can see them waiting for nothing, on platforms and sidewalks whistling. I pick every one of them up, whether washed in a sidewalk pool or peppered with black grit. All of them are pocketed, put in a jar and carried back shaking and fumbling on top of each other in desperation.


-------------


Notable that Om picks up pennies wherever he goes.

Sometimes I skipped the train. After throwing away work, adding more work, shuffling work, I threw a few goodbyes back as I walked out the door. I walked over the hot sidewalk grills, feeling the damp warm air on some of them and then bland stale air above others. Everyone rushed and stood cramped in subway cars underneath me, all buried together, while I walked above them, free, with air. The walks were usually brisk and clean.

Mostly the streets were useless, famished for something alive as I walked by. Alley after alley was empty save bits of people and trash. But if you'd look closer, and a glimpse into an apartment window with a huge bare breasted lady or a man wambling with his dog made it feel like the blocks had some life. But these people were beaten down a while ago. The night, the polluted ocean of water and hurtful words, the boxes they lived in. The city never sleeps but everyone is always tired.








I sometimes forgot the sun existed in New York. It didn't mean as much to me but I felt it should have. I desperately wanted to love it. I wanted to love the bizarre alleys. Sometimes I asked age old shop owners selling nothing but rare instruments, shelves full of trinkets no one bought, thick oily pastries dying to be loved... How they did it everyday and why they did it every single day. There were no smiles behind the whispy beards, behind the grey stubbles or their glazed wrinkled eyes. Some ignored me, but mostly they whispered "I don't know". I don't know.





It was pretty silent in the apartment mostly.

The parties turned me off, and I began declining to go to them. Over the course of a few months I slowly started resisting to go out with anyone except band practice with Selina and a few shows sprinkled between them. Work was a chore. I booked it reasonably every chance I got. It was pretty easy with Renee, she barely made it out to dinners with her friends. The nights we stayed home I cooked, always an inviting challenge to cook a dinner with only four ingredients with no spices and somehow make it flavorful.

That apartment grew smaller. I don't remember too much from those days. I guess it was more about _what_ I remembered those days.

I remember my mother's yogurt soup and Khash. The bread carts. The countless electrical wires above the streets. All the skirmishes. My dad, constantly on the phone. The instability. The made up girls. The phone glued to his head. My brother and sister shouting at each other. The final move to Canada. My final move to the US.






Before I knew it I missed the few months I brushed off, as usual. Not because they meant something, but because I wasted them.
