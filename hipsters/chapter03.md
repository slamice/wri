Ch3. Time drags on. He shuffles his feet, wondering how he got here. He recalls his family, how his mother hated Lebanon and how his father loved it. Also how his brothers were there. Then they sent him happily overseas. The feeling he gets when he arrives at college is freedom, and he begins drinking. He meets Ryan in his dorm.

Om feels disengaged and tired. The point of the chapter is to show how Om has widdled down. Apart from band practice and work, he stays home. He goes to bed earlier but wakes up the same time everyday. He hates thinking about the past but does it anyway. He remembers his silent parents. He recalls how much he hated highschool. He feels lonely. Selina is in the area and he meets up with her once. Coffee cup scene.

Most of the time the buildings don't exist. They disappear and the slow traffic and indifferent expressions toss me a few thoughts to juggle. They hit my face and stick for a bit then fall to the sidewalk.

My family

There's always a neglected penny everywhere. You can see them waiting for nothing, on platforms and sidewalks whistling. I pick every one of them up, whether washed in a sidewalk pool or peppered with black grit. All of them are pocketed, put in a jar and carried back shaking and fumbling on top of each other in desperation.

Notable that Om picks up pennies wherever he goes.

Sometimes I skipped the train. After throwing away work, adding more work, shuffling work, I threw a few goodbyes back as I walked out the door. I walked over the hot sidewalk grills, feeling the damp warm air on some of them and then bland stale air above others. Everyone rushed and stood cramped in subway cars underneath me, all buried together, while I walked above them, free, with air. The walks were usually brisk and clean.

Mostly the streets were useless, famished for something alive as I walked by. Alley after alley was empty save bits of people and trash. But if you'd look closer, and a glimpse into an apartment window with a huge bare breasted lady or a man wambling with his dog made it feel like the blocks had some life. But these people were beaten down a while ago. The night, the polluted ocean of water and hurtful words, the boxes they lived in. The city never sleeps but everyone is always tired.








I sometimes forgot the sun existed in New York. It didn't mean as much to me but I felt it should have. I desperately wanted to love it. I wanted to love the bizarre alleys. Sometimes I asked age old shop owners selling nothing but rare instruments, shelves full of trinkets no one bought, thick oily pastries dying to be loved... How they did it everyday and why they did it every single day. There were no smiles behind the whispy beards, behind the grey stubbles or their glazed wrinkled eyes. Some ignored me, but mostly they whispered "I don't know". I don't know.





It was pretty silent in the apartment mostly.

The parties turned me off, and I began declining to go to them. Over the course of a few months I slowly started resisting to go out with anyone except band practice with Selina and a few shows sprinkled between them. Work was a chore. I booked it reasonably every chance I got. It was pretty easy with Renee, she barely made it out to dinners with her friends. The nights we stayed home I cooked, always an inviting challenge to cook a dinner with only four ingredients with no spices and somehow make it flavorful.

That apartment grew smaller. I don't remember too much from those days. I guess it was more about _what_ I remembered those days.

I remember my mother's yogurt soup and Khash. The bread carts. The countless electrical wires above the streets. All the skirmishes. My dad, constantly on the phone. The instability. The made up girls. The phone glued to his head. My brother and sister shouting at each other. The final move to Canada. My final move to the US.






Before I knew it I missed the few months I brushed off, as usual. Not because they meant something, but because I wasted them.
