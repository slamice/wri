*TODO* Possibly time has passed from seeing Jack, explain how they are flaky and barely talk to each other anyway? Or that they slowly have been growing apart since college because narrator Om is losing interest?


Ch3 . Renee is still connected with his old friends. Eventually they go to jack's place. The point of this chapter is to develop the story behind Renee and her self victimization, also Om's growing ambivalence and hate for his social circle.














The receptionist, also limo dispatcher, was there. Behind that counter was a huge grin, a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She now hobbled busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone 3000km away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight. She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" She laughed hard. I picked through the letters. Renee took her phone bill and some sales flyers unabashed.

Another week, no notices. The government shrugged and said nothing. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me.

We opened the apartment door. We were greeted by Renee's cat hurling puddles of hiss and screams in our faces. The utter joy.
