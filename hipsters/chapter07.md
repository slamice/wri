Ch7. Another show, Mexico City happens here. Om's infatuation with bands happens here. He gets a call from his family in the middle again. This chapter shows the nature of a live show, how slightly awkward and banal it is. Om has seen these bands dozens of times. He discusses circuit bending, how a famous musician stayed at someone's house. Boombastic plays.

Meets up with Dock in this chapter.

It was tasteless, the thing i was drinking. It sat in a pool of itself, and didn't get any better the more I stirred it. How many shots of sugar and coffee muttered inside.

- emotional breakdown -



-- Talk about person based on damo -

"He stayed over at my place." He said it with a huge smiling smug mug.

"What's he like?"

"He's unreal, honestly. I mean ow he's pretty old, like sixty or so, but he still has a thick German accent. He smoked up a lot when we were there. I don't have a car either so I had to pay for his taxis, since he was getting older he couldnt walk much anywhere."

And you explode.
















...


Talk at concert about circuit bending, blabbing to friends about how big of an annoyance talking about it with someone was.

talk about how bands isn't great, get told off.






There were only two of them now on stage. The lackluster crowd blew bubbles and shuffled in place silently. The one in the back wore aviator shades a la seventies. Familiar dry techno hums suddenly sounded, and as they dribbled into the room the messy blonde hair picked up the mike and dug it in behind his mop. He staggered a bit, having drunken a few.



As the crowd slowly dispersed I depressed against the front of the stage. The blonde singer bore a beer in hand. Somehow his eye caught mine and we drifted toward each other. The background mug clinks and chats drowned out most of our words. They weren't needed though. Because between sips, his breathe and half drunken elequence he made all his points.

"Interesting set."

"You're welcome."

"I actually didn't like the song about Mexico City. Though."

I could barely hear him when he yelled "Why?!".

And I said I just didn't like it. Provoking. Of course no one was allowed to say it but I gave it a shot. I didn't care about him not caring how much his voice syntha-sized sucked.

"No no no. You don't understand man. You don't understand. It was Brazilian minimal techno, a mix of Brian Eno's best dance stuff he was doing in the late 90's. Hip hop, you know Mexican hip-hop? You'll have to listen to it again I don't believe you you just don't understand it..."

I said "Yea, maybe I don't understand it."

"No it's ok you have to realize this is great."

And like that soon we faded awkwardly into a crowd of awkwards.

He went on for a while about how he opened perfectly functioning keyboards and hacked at them, destroying them from the inside, cutting wires and then painting them to make frankensteinian machines. Not a passion, but something that's done. The sounds that came out of one of them, the one that played that night, were clanging broken mutated trash can lids. So instead of a cacophony, he explained, it was ~cacophonous~.



Circuit bending sucked. My disgusted stride to the door was obvious and of course no one thought much of it.



Outside you could faintly hear techno dribbling with a tiny weary pitch tacked on. The swathes of people around each bar and club entrance were positioned like moles on a Miley face. They more or less spilled into the street. But among the pockets of high heelers and ragged jeans must have been something else, but maybe not.



Frustrated, some of my thoughts repositioned themselves angrily, shuffling and fidgeting in their seats. How many of these people cared and worried about who cared about them, and how many didn't and actually did. How many parents and friends were behind them, supporting them. How many acknowledged themselves. How many cried in angst over it. Or felt shuttered for ridiculous amounts of time.



One girl sat on the step of her walkup disgruntled with her friends.



I took the train a few stops. I watched a kid try to find some flab on his mother's arms, slapping them as her bagged eyes watched on. I was caught in a car with a tap dancing trumpeter. I angrily stared him down as he shortly asked for his change.



The door was open and surprisingly Renee was gone. The cat whined whinily as I walked in and was heavily ignored. There should have been music, a record playing, something industrial, but I was too lazy to choose.

Renee slept next to me with the cat lazily on top of her.

That night I laid dumb in my bed waiting. And waiting. ((Not for Renee.))
