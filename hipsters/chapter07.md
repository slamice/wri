...

Talk at concert about circuit bending, blabbing to friends about how big of an annoyance talking about it with someone was.

talk about how bands isnt great, get told off.

"I actually didn't like the song about Mexico City."
I could barely hear him when he yelled "Why?!".
And I said I just didn't like it. Of course no one was allowed to say it but I truly thought it and gave it a shot. I didn't care about him not caring how much his voice syntha-sized sucked.
"No no no. You don't understand man. You don't understand. It was Brazilian minimal techno, a mix of brian eno's best dance stuff he was doing in the late 90's. Hip hop, you know mexican hip-hop? You'll have to listen to it again I don't believe you you just don't understand it"...
I said "Yea, maybe I don't understand it."
"No it's ok you have to realize this is great."
And like that soon we faded awkwardly into a crowd of awkwards.
