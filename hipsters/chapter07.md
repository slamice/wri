Ch7. Another show, Mexico City happens here. Om's infatuation with bands happens here. He gets a call from his family in the middle again. This chapter shows the nature of a live show, how slightly awkward and banal it is. Om has seen these bands dozens of times. He discusses circuit bending, how a famous musician stayed at someone's house. Boombastic plays.

Meets up with Dock in this chapter.

Talk at concert about circuit bending, blabbing to friends about how big of an annoyance talking about it with someone was.

talk about how bands isn't great, get told off.



...

Despite all the vapers outside, smoke still lingered and began to settling. The hazy room held leather and jean jackets of all characters and shapes. I pushed a bit through expecting to find Selina or someone I knew, but it was a loss with this crowd and I was sure she wasn't there yet. I decided to just take to watching the stage silently as the band on it bled its electronic heart out.

There were only two on stage. The lackluster crowd blew bubbles and shuffled in place silently. The band member in the back wore aviator shades a la seventies. Familiar dry techno hums suddenly sounded, and as they dribbled into the room like repeated fingers wrapping on a table. The other, a messy blonde hair picked up the mike and dug it in behind his mop. He staggered a bit, having drunken a few.

They droned on and the set slowed. Every beat was maticulously calously calculated, every song featured the singer closing his eyes tight in a forced bliss. We watched on until it ended and we couldn't and most filed to the bar.

As the crowd slowly dispersed I depressed against the front of the stage. The blonde singer appeared, bearing a beer in hand. Somehow his eye caught mine and we drifted toward each other. The background mug clinks and chats drowned out most of our words. They weren't needed though. Because between sips, his breathe and half drunken elequence he made all his points.

"Interesting set."

"You're welcome."

"I actually didn't like the song about Mexico City. Though."

I could barely hear him when he yelled "Why?!".

And I said I just didn't like it. Provoking. Of course no one was allowed to say it but I gave it a shot. I didn't care about him not caring how much his voice syntha-sized sucked.

"No no no. You don't understand man. You don't understand. It was Brazilian minimal techno, a mix of Brian Eno's best dance stuff he was doing in the late 90's. Hip hop, you know Mexican hip-hop? You'll have to listen to it again I don't believe you you just don't understand it..."

I said "Yea, maybe I don't understand it."

"No it's ok you have to realize this is great."

There was an awkward silence between us while the room crunched papers of conversation.

"You liked the other stuff right?"

"Maybe." I said.

And like that soon we faded awkwardly into a crowd of awkwards.

I noticed Gaby, Dock's ex was in the crowd.

"Hi Gaby" I said. Her tan skin complemented her polka dotted apron skirt. The grey white collared shirt accented the two ear piercings per ear. The contract of white socks with black shoes flattered her. Her spanish short hair was in a bob, and long eye lashes held tightly to her real ones.

"Hey, it's been a while, yea?"

"Yea no kidding it has. What's going on?"

"Nothing much. "

I thought about topics, any really because we shared almost none. Then I remembered "Hey I heard Ernst Hirsch stayed at your place! That's crazy."

"Yea isn't that? Who told you that?" she said it with a huge smiling smug mug.

"Hmm, Dock actually. What's he like?"

"He's unreal, honestly. I mean now he's pretty old, like sixty or so, but he still has a thick German accent. He smoked up a lot when we were there. I don't have a car either so I had to pay for his taxis, since he was getting older he couldnt walk much anywhere."

"That's what I would have expected though, but that's awesome."

Dock came up inevitably. "You see Dock a lot?" Gaby asked. 

"Honestly not really recently. He's working a lot and we don't really have much in common anymore."

What's he up to. Yes they talk occassionally. Not that much but recently they started talking again.



----------------------------

talking to Andrew:

As I was walking away I heard him say something.

"You know she's a whore" Andy's voice said clearly, and I looked back at him and he had a straight face. I could feel him wanting to smile but he was good at hiding it.

((The narrator knows what he said ^ but doesn't aknowledge it until a bit.))

"What?"

"Nothing." he said.

"What did you say?"

"I didn't say anything, damn..." and his eyes started to calm and was preparing for a holistic ramble, but I took the pause to mentally trail off in anger. 

((The room muted in my ears, and I hated myself for saying nothing, so I forced out a very clear "Fuck you Andrew." Perhaps a little too much so, because a bit of spit trickled out of my mouth.)) <- Does he shy away and cower or fight?

My greasy hair smudged the glass as I leaned against the train car window. I could hear them, everyone in the room. Quick glances at me were telling, imaginary or not. They told me to grow up. I was pathetic. No, they never said those things to me. They talked about them amongst themselves though. Sharing it as a matter of fact secret they just happened to have remembered, even though they'd pocketed it for a bored moment.

My jacket was too heavy. My jeans too uncomfortable. My neck hurt.

It was tasteless, the thing i was drinking. It sat in a pool of itself, and didn't get any better the more I stirred it. How many shots of sugar and coffee muttered inside.

And you explode.

He went on for a while about how he opened perfectly functioning keyboards and hacked at them, destroying them from the inside, cutting wires and then painting them to make frankensteinian machines. Not a passion, but something that's done. The sounds that came out of one of them, the one that played that night, were clanging broken mutated trash can lids. So instead of a cacophony, he explained, it was ~cacophonous~.



Circuit bending sucked. My disgusted stride to the door was obvious and of course no one thought much of it.



Outside you could faintly hear techno dribbling with a tiny weary pitch tacked on. The swathes of people around each bar and club entrance were positioned like moles on a Miley face. They more or less spilled into the street. But among the pockets of high heelers and ragged jeans must have been something else, but maybe not.



Frustrated, some of my thoughts repositioned themselves angrily, shuffling and fidgeting in their seats. How many of these people cared and worried about who cared about them, and how many didn't and actually did. How many parents and friends were behind them, supporting them. How many acknowledged themselves. How many cried in angst over it. Or felt shuttered for ridiculous amounts of time.



One girl sat on the step of her walkup disgruntled with her friends.



I took the train a few stops. I watched a kid try to find some flab on his mother's arms, slapping them as her bagged eyes watched on. I was caught in a car with a tap dancing trumpeter. I angrily stared him down as he shortly asked for his change.



The door was open and surprisingly Renee was gone. The cat whined whinily as I walked in and was heavily ignored. There should have been music, a record playing, something industrial, but I was too lazy to choose.

---------





Renee slept next to me with the cat lazily on top of her.

That night I laid dumb in my bed waiting. And waiting. ((Not for Renee.))
