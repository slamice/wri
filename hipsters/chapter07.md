Ch7. Another show, Mexico City happens here. Om's infatuation with bands happens here. He gets a call from his family in the middle again. This chapter shows the nature of a live show, how slightly awkward and banal it is. Om has seen these bands dozens of times. He discusses circuit bending, how a famous musician stayed at someone's house. Boombastic plays.













...

Talk at concert about circuit bending, blabbing to friends about how big of an annoyance talking about it with someone was.

talk about how bands isn't great, get told off.






There were only two of them now on stage. The lackluster crowd blew bubbles and shuffled in place silently. The one in the back wore aviator shades a la seventies. Familiar dry techno hums suddenly sounded, and as they dribbled into the room the messy blonde hair picked up the mike and dug it in behind his mop. He staggered a bit, having drunken a few.



As the crowd slowly dispersed I depressed against the front of the stage. The blonde singer bore a beer in hand. Somehow his eye caught mine and we drifted toward each other. The background mug clinks and chats drowned out most of our words. They weren't needed though. Because between sips, his breathe and half drunken elequence he made all his points.

"Interesting set."

"You're welcome."

"I actually didn't like the song about Mexico City. Though."

I could barely hear him when he yelled "Why?!".

And I said I just didn't like it. Provoking. Of course no one was allowed to say it but I gave it a shot. I didn't care about him not caring how much his voice syntha-sized sucked.

"No no no. You don't understand man. You don't understand. It was Brazilian minimal techno, a mix of Brian Eno's best dance stuff he was doing in the late 90's. Hip hop, you know Mexican hip-hop? You'll have to listen to it again I don't believe you you just don't understand it..."

I said "Yea, maybe I don't understand it."

"No it's ok you have to realize this is great."

And like that soon we faded awkwardly into a crowd of awkwards.
