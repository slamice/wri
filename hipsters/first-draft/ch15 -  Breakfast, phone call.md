Her dishes laid in my shelves a few days until I boxed them up and put them outside my door, but Renee never came to take them. Later that week I got home to find a notice on my door with Raf apologizing, saying he was sorry but someone came foreward about the apartment zoning and threw us all under the bus. And if it was me then he'd get my ass.

I didn't think she did it. But my name was the only one on the lease.

...

Of course the real deal was the greasy spoon that was closest when you wake up. The place was owned by a huge balding man out of the 50's to make it authentically awful, and as white as the toast you ate there as possible. Late breakfast at Bons off Broadway.

If you have seen one greasy spoon then you get the understand completely. But really, you haven't seen them all. There are varying degrees of greasiness, eahc one worse than the next.

Bons on Broadway, for example, was a legendary diner with high school students and high school student imitators. It was amazing what people would eat. Breakfast there was all day, so realistically people are in there around 11 or noon.

While waiting for food you may take on the following roles:
1. Talk about drunken shinanegans that happened the night before, which are rarely significant and barely shape a story.
2. Stack creamers in a pyramid shape.
3. Shake a creamer until it turns into butter, which takes the entire breakfast.
4. Writher in disgust as the waiter gives you a jug of water, and at the bottom is one of his punk bracelet spikes.

The food had two eggs swimming in oil, with fried frozen hash browns. That experience was $2.99... So about $3.15 with tax.

We went there at 11am, and of course it was crowded because everyone woke up at 10:54am and staggered down form their beds.

I ventured past the line and saw Selina sitting with some of her fellow doo-dads, but no Adrian on site. Selina opened her arms and people gruffled various half assed hellos. She saved me a seat as I listened to their relationship issues patiently.

Selina turned to me and we kept our voices low.

"The deed," I paused, "is done." and I dusted off my hands.

"I'm sorry she's gone." Selina sadly determined.

"I'm ecstatic. Thrilled beyond thrilled. The apartment is empty and I'm ready to do anything. "

"I thought you'd be taking it a bit harder."

"Things get put into perspective. Exchanges are made. Peices are picked up and then they fall. The drawl is long and slow. And suddenly the submarine surfaces. And teh coast is damn clear. And suddenly it's empty and I can masturbate and dance while I clean and it's a clean apartment!"

"Mental masturbation." Selina corrects me.

"Yes, mental. MANtal."

"Not mantal. Anyone can."

"Absolutely anyone, I agree. High fives and all. She's gone. A waste of time flushed. I wasted so much time Selina. Just in general. I can't wait for this tour. Tell me we settled everything."

Selina looked a bit off and worried, but still smiling. "Honeslty, they haven't gotten back to me. I mean initially it was good, but I haven't heard from their manager in over a week. Maybe if we talk to the band. I wouldn't get our hopes up Om. Our propisition was flimsy. We can continue to give it a shot though." Her mouth twisted, waiting for my reaction. "I'm super happy for you. Also this means we'll see you more!"

Who the we was I'll never know. At this point I felt like a painting in Selina's friends lives. A painting of brick colors matching the wall it hung on.


.....

My phone hummed my brother was calling me. It seemed uneventful at the time. And I sluggishly floundered to pick it up.

"Hey Ilias." I said.

"Hey" he said back.

"It's pretty late there."

"Yea well we're all up."

"Why? What happened? Did something happen to mom?"

"Well, Dad isn't here."

"Why isn't Dad there. Is he ok?" I started to panic.

"He's probably fine. He's not answering his phone though."

"What--"

"Omar. Listen, Mom's asleep, but he left a note. Do you want me to read you the note?"

I hesitated, "A note."

"Yea you want me to read it? I can sum it up for you."

"Ok--" I tried to swallow but my mouth was super dry. "Well, please read it."

--> Dear lovely children,

... mother with Lukemia ...

... leaving ...

My older sister piped up, her voice grew louder and eventually my brother put her on speaker "He's basically selfish. It's probably the most selfish thing you can do. What does he figure? He's a damn coward."

She went on and on. About how he never lover our mother, or her, or any of us. How he worked all the time and his porn habit and his flirting and the fights he and her had. I seriously tried to pay attention to her this time, but my mind trailed off. First it debated reality, then sat wondering what to do. During a silence Ilias took the chance and grabbed back the phone.

"We asked the doctor how long she'll be here. They said they could send her home in a week or two or a month or two, tehy don't know. But she'll have to come back again."

"You talk to Uncle ((Armenian name))?"

"Yea we did. He's catching the next flight here. He of course offered to take her but I don't know if the hospitals there are any better than the ones here. We're not sure if she can take the plane ride right now anyway. I have to ask are you making good money there?"


(((I knelt on the sidewalk in the fetal position. It could have been that people walked by me, dogs, not sure. I was definitely on an island there in front of the sophisticated gentleman's brunch, and I was alone.))




"I'm making ok money."

"We're probably going to need it. Sabra d--"

"I have a job but it's not enough." Sabra interjected, "I don't think it's enough. We don't know what's going to happen."

"You can't come back?" he asked.

There was a long nasty pause then.

"It really sucks you're not here Omar." ((Nothing you can do to come back?))

pause.

"Yea I know. I wish I was there."

"We wish you were here too. We're stronger together."

pause.

"We're both tired. We're going to go to sleep and come back here tomorrow."

"I'll give you a call later. We'll figure it out. You think this is for real?"

"Even if it isn't," his voice shook a tiny bit "what are we going to do. Have a good night."

"Impossible. Goodnight." My voice dampened.

And we hung up.

At some point in the phone call my stomach to the brim with heaviness and my mouth was very dry. 

No holding back. No end and no coming back. A tight noose around my neck. I squated down on the sidewalk feeling a few hot tears roll down, absently watching the people stroll by absent in their own heads as was I in mine. My face was beet red and dry.

Eventually Selina wondered why I was gone for almost half an hour and came out. She blocked the sun and stared at me while the deaf weirds and beards trotted behind her.

I stared back at her and shook my head. My nose was cold.
