Ch11. Wedding + Prof fight

----------

One friday in Mik's office, cubed off in the corner with designer clout and magic, was a proud achievement of corporate culture. I stood in that office that morning, an obstruction.

He called me in, smiling and giddy. We chatted about Mik's fmaily and work gossip, and the morning light brightened our conversation with happy notes. followed by coffees and teas and toast and jam and kids laughing and subtle nuances. It was all going down a long disgusting drain.

"Do you mind closing the door for a second?"

Quickly all his jokes vanished, scurrying scared into all corners of the room then just out the door before it shut. His skin somehow paled further, an incredible feat for a native Belgian. His eyes grew sunken in and hollowed out. His plain stare told me You Need to Love What You Do. YNTWYD.

"Maybe we should talk about you."

"I know I can do this." I forced a timid smile out to my lips. I practiced it in case a day like this would come.

"The longer you take to figure that out the more time you are wasting." He was staring at me dead on, I was too caught up and barely noticed his shoulder shrug.

He smiled back at me unapologetically. I was wondering if he was enjoying it, our entire friendly talk earlier a sham.

"How about we give it a month?"

I looked back at him and again he smiled, "a month, right?"

Walking back to my desk, my chest heaved a sigh. All the jeans and lattes the world chugged out were thrown to the floor. I saw pathetic coffee cups and free snacks tehc ompany offered wading down a stream. They were tasteless garbage. I hope no one noticed how nasious I was. My anxieties played and the words and symbols danced the rest of the day around my screen in front of a picture of a mountain top I only just noticed.

I went to the bathroom. Post lunch, the mirrror wasn't clear, bits of dust and floss aftermath speckled it. A headache was stirring up from the back of my mind. It began reeling, slowly, until it nestled snug right behind my immediate thoughts.

I waved at the faucet to spray out a tiny cold shower of water. Each drop threw itself dying on my hands, rolling dead down the drain. Maybe I'd dillute my shock with Michael, he wouldn't understand but listen. That's not what happened.

A coffee excuse could work, but when I approached his desk he was hunched over it, in such a deep forboding mood. His fingers heavily smashed down on each key to a black and white screen messed with text. It was a clear sign of frustration to remove all the syntactical sugar, the rainbow of colors that highlighted special parts of the code to aid in development. He stripped down his workplace completely to barely anything to make it run faster. I then noticed, besides his jacket, he threw all his notes out in some desperate plea to start over.

I was seconds away from tapping him on either shoulder but, in a rage, he erected himself furiously to the ceiling and tore the laptop from its cords. He slammed it on the desk again and again, spitting out fuckword after fuckword. A few peices of the machine and his curses flew to the floor, and neighboring cubicle-ers ducked. He walked out miserable right by me to the exit. His laptop lay in a mildly unpleasant electronic heap, a box with a broken frame.

 We all stared at his leave in confusion. I thought briefly about following him with the crowd but no one else did. The entire office looked at eachother, mulling over the scene again. Slowly the sounds of typing started up, and they forgot.

I gave him a few minutes, and then found him outside, looking up at the sky with what was probably his second cigarette.

"I'm too old for this shit Om. I hate all of it. How bad was it?" He didn't have to look at me, he was too embarassed to anyway. The cigarette danced in his shaking hand.

"It was basically like watching a one sided fight."

"I'm resigning obviously." 

"For what?"




...

"I just wanted to win. Then after I won, there was nothing left to do. Just rinse and repeat."

"Maybe," hmmmm... "Maybe you have to redefine what winning means?"

He took me in finally, a long look that got longer, "Winning doesn't mean anything. You know what I do nights? I read programmign notes and design architecture and I'm fucking getting older. I don't even know what winning is here. If I move up, I don't give a shit about managing. I barely care about coding."

"What do you want to do?"

He actually thought about it, looking like a university student staring at upcoming courses deciding years of engorssment, possibly the rest of his life.

"I _didn't want_ to change Om. But I gave up a peice of myself to be here. Maybe it was a mistake."

The rest of the day slogged. Michael quit that day, and two weeks later he was gone. He left his references and creds but we won't get in touch.










































That friday early winter weather ruffled us as I walked there with her. The serenity of the situation was dying down but still trying to grope me in all the wrong places. If it would have groped me in the right ones at least I'd have a thrill.

The lady bug skirt Renee wore bunched at her knees. ((make her sound gross here))

The modern couple bore exact resemblance to each other holistically. They met on a boat to Govener's island eight years ago. Their dreams together were spent in cafes, camping, back in her French hometown. She accentuated every mutilated word and he drank them all in, a bit dripping into his beard. I knew everyone going, not by name but barely by face.

We arrived almost too late at the park and positioned ourselves behind the Parisian mother. Her brooch slowly ate at her shirt black jacket, but she didn't notice because her nose was pulled so high up to the sky by a fish hook. She shook, smiling and distraught at her daughter. A single bead of sweat dared not come down her wrinkled forehead.

The ceremony lasted roughly ten minutes. The priest put down his beer and settled on the podium, leaning against a stand for bocce players to keep their score. It was far enough to ignore their game.

The sermon raged socio-political arguments at the church. A few 'likes' and 'hmm's were thrown in for good measure, all the while the couple smiled into each other's faces. Beaming a few beams at their immigrant parents. Some of their friends hung their heads low and their backs were turned out on invisible hooks.

Rice was tossed along with a few slinkies. They headed towards a picnic table full of strawberries, cake and salmon.

Suddenly a traveling quartet arrived. No one claimed them for the wedding, but they trailed up to us anyway. Someone laughed earnestly that this was the bride's French gypsy roots bringing some home with solemn symbols crashing and dancing. The oompa loompa band danced forward and stopped in front of the couple. No one was speechless and we talked over their looks.





The oompa-loomps band jawed and jeered thick horn drawls and hard drum beats at us. We watched wide eyed, smiling and puzzled. The finale was a ten second free jazz sax solo, and they held it out with their hands on their knees with wide eyes, almost in tears.

Their ring leader, Thin man Dan walked out in front of us. I knew him from playing a few shows here and there around Brooklyn. He was a tall pencil head who played a tenor sax like a gift teasing us. The band quieted their harmonies until it was only him playing. He did a jig soloing to the air, and all at once stopped suddenly. We all clapped profusely at his talent and beret.

"Friends!" He raised his arms. "We don't know you but applaud this hefty wager you're playing with life. We're all with you, but we're gambling just by throwing in our hats," he tipped his dusty top hat off. It landed with a tiny crunch on the grass. Dan paused. A few people glanced at the hat then back at him. "Shakespeare once said in a mixed review play" he bellowed "'All the world is a stage! You get hitched and life's a bitch!' So please let us be your audience and see through it that you have a happy ending."

He finally lowered his hands and presented them to the couple, "Congratulations!"

Everyone bellowed a few hurrahs and shook hands. The rich parents fluttered about with food and berries as the younger crowd lazily sullied up to the food tables. The fare was fairly better than the usual fodder, cellophane unwrapped delicately. Some drinks were poured and everyone's brains started to get lubed up in the middle of the afternoon.

It turned out Renee knew many people here for years. Marty was an ex-boyfriend and former singer of a sell out band now heading North to work in a hemp factory he's a nice guy you'd like him for sure. Another friend she fell out of touch with because of a cold war relationship in their English class in University.

"Evangeline!" Renee exclaimed.

Conversations built on solid partial memories and strong Hey!s became brittle. Feeling like a trophy hanging limply from a hand, I idled away around the park and sulked against a tree. In a nearby shop I almost bought a cookbook, but I could be moving soon so I didn't. My forehead shined and glazed in the bit of sun that made it through that cloudy day.

Another game of boce started up, and the old Italians measured the balls carefully. In the near distance blurred distance tight jeans intermingled with clad steampunk dresses. Renee very slowly walked over to me, and I looked up at her.

"What's up?" Renee stood over me.

I sat silent, still looking at her face, but mostly her hair.

She sequined her words into a fashionable sing song "When are we getting married, Om?"

That day I stared into Renee's eyes, and her into mine. I wasn't sure what I saw, or was supposed to see. They were like any others, and it wasn't like I could stare into eyes that long anyway. I guess it was a boon, really. When you can stare and no one is offended, or aggravated, or aggitated or uncomfortable. I imagine it used to be that everyone was allowed to stare into the other's eyes until they realized they loved them, meant something to them or weren't dead yet. I stared into Renee's eyes and I watched my fisheyed reflection watching back at me. One thing I didn't expect was to find myself in there, especially since people usually move too much to notice that.

We both knew the answer but were completely ignorant about it.((?))
