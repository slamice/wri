Ch11. Wedding + Prof fight

----------

Mik's office was cubed off in a corner with designer clout and magic. Truly a proud achievement of corporate culture on the march of progress. One Friday morning I stood there, an obstruction.

He called me in, smiling and giddy. We chatted about Mik's family and work gossip, and the morning light brightened our conversation with happy notes. It was closely followed by coffees and teas and toast and jam and kids laughing and subtle nuances. All of it was going down a long disgusting drain.

"Mind closing the door for a second?"

Quickly all his jokes vanished, scurrying scared into all nooks of the room then out the door before it shut. Mik's skin somehow paled further, an incredible feat for a native Belgian. His eyes grew sunken in and hollowed out. His plain stare told me You Need to Love What You Do. YNTWYD.

"Maybe we should talk about you."

"I know I can do this." I forced a timid smile to my lips. I practiced it in the mirror a few times in case a day like that would come, but it failed me.

"The longer you take to figure that out the more time you're wasting. And not just your time." He was staring at me dead on, I was so surprised by it and barely noticed his shoulder shrug.

He smiled back at me unapologetically. I wondered if he was enjoyed our entire talk earlier revealing itself to be a sham.

"How about we give it a month? That's plenty of time right? We can talk then."

I took a deep ook out the window, and again he smiled, "a month, right? Let's see."

Walking back to my desk, my chest heaved a sigh. Holed jeans and lattes the world chugged out were thrown to the floor. The company's pathetic cups and free snacks waded down a stream. They were tasteless garbage. Nauseous, my anxieties played and the words and symbols danced the rest of the day around my screen, only then noticing the background; a picture of an intimidating mountain top.

In the office bathroom after a tasteless lunch. The mirror was speckled with dust and bits of floss aftermath. A headache was stirring up, my mind reeled it in slowly until it nestled snug right behind my immediate thoughts.

I waved at the faucet to spray out a tiny cold shower. Each drop threw itself dying on my hands, rolling dead down the drain. Maybe I'd dilute my shock with Michael, he wouldn't understand but he'd listen. That's not what happened, anyway.

A coffee run excuse could work, but when I approached his desk he was hunched over, in such a deep foreboding mood that it made me guess his age again. His fingers heavily smashed down each key to a black & white screen messed with text. It was a clear sign of frustration to remove all the syntactical sugar, the rainbow of colors that highlighted special parts of the code to aid in development. His workplace was stripped completely to a bare anything at all to make things cleaner and run faster. I then noticed, besides his jacket, piles of notes thrown out in some desperate plea to start over.

I was seconds away from tapping him on either shoulder but, in a sudden rage, he erected himself furiously to the ceiling and tore the laptop from its cords. He slammed it on the desk again and again, spitting out fuckword after fuckword. A few peices of the machine and his curses flew to the floor, and neighboring cubicle-ers ducked. He walked out miserable right by me to the exit. His laptop lay in a mildly unpleasant electronic heap, a box with a broken frame.

 We all stared at his leave in confusion. I thought briefly about following him with the crowd but no one else did. The entire office looked at eachother, mulling over the scene again. Slowly the sounds of typing started up, and they forgot.

I gave him a few minutes then found him outside, looking up at the sky with what was probably his second cigarette. "How bad was it?" His spoke quietly, smoke danced above his shaking hand.

"It was basically like watching a one sided fight."

"I'm resigning obviously."

"For what?"

"For what."

We lay against the concrete and watched the people rush by, our hearts hanging in our throats. I wondered what those people wanted? The lady with the stroller, an angry lawyer, a skateboarder as they disappeared behind corners into oblivion. And then again a thousand others appeared in their place.

"Maybe," hmmmm... "Maybe you have to redefine what winning means?"

His eyes finally met mine, a long look that got longer, "Winning doesn't mean anything anymore."

"What do you want to do?"

He breathed out heavily and I mimiced him.

"I _didn't want_ to change Om. But I gave up a peice of myself to be here. I had no choice but, maybe it was a mistake."

The rest of the day slogged. Two weeks later Michael was gone.

...

That weekend Renee walked to a park for a wedding and towed me along. We knew everyone going, not all by name but barely by face. We knew them through parties mostyly, but the to be bride worked with Renee briefly relabeling expired medicine. They had coffee a few times and she slipped in an invitation.

Saturday early winter weather nipped at us with afternoon traffic kept us company the whole way. As we began to forget our situation the awkwardness of eachother died down significantly and we enjoyed our silence. Halfway there but still tried to grope me in all the wrong places. It was a shame, because at least I could have had a thrill if it groped me in the right ones.

The ceremony took place in a small field by the swings and bocce fields, just far enough to avoid interrupting a game. There were enough picnic tables for the thirty or so of us. The food waited under plastic patiently as the laggers arrived. As we approached we could see a few of the elders wore suits but most knew better. Renee's ladybug skirt had leggings that bunched at her knees. I wore a casual button up with rolled up sleeves. I forgot one of the cuff buttons were missing.

((bocce is a very bizarre game, try to hit balls to be close enough together, knowck them around, kind of stupid))




We saw the bride's parents. He mother's spidery brooch slowly ate at her black shirt jacket, but she didn't notice because her nose was pulled shamelesly so high up to the sky by a fish hook. She shook, smiling and distraught for her daughter. Her face and wrinkled forhead plush was on thick. Her father was just as decorated. He was too distracted counting the unmet expectations around him. I felt a kinship grow towards him throughout the day. How alien it must have been to him, perhaps the only one there who owned a watch.

I felt Renee's hand on my shoulder, honestly it felt worse than being broke.

The modern couple bore exact resemblance to each other holistically. They met on a boat to Govener's island eight years ago. Their dreams together were spent in cafes, camping, back in her French hometown. She accentuated every mutilated English word and he drank them all in, a bit dripping into his beard. 

Some birds chirped, which was nice but not helping. The priest put down his beer and settled on the podium, leaning against a stand for bocce players to keep their score. He began his sermon raging socio-political arguments at the church. A few 'likes' and 'hmm's were thrown in for good measure, all the while the couple smiled into each other's faces. I double taked his immigrant parents and her bone bred Frenchers. Some of their friends hung their heads low and their backs were turned out on invisible hooks. Most of it was boring, but some of it stuck like gum or RED 48 dye in my stomach.

((Maybe priest talks about how they met, also notes to eachother?))


"... And on this beautiful day, who can say that they don't fight with all our hearts and souls for one another? Let the flood gates of peace and prosperity open up and crash down on this couple. They're now ready to brave the storm of True Matramony(TM).

And isn't this matramony? Isn't this some sweet holy stuff?"

The ceremony lasted roughly ten minutes. The kiss I have to say was passionate, just as much as Renee's cold cheek on my shoulder. Everyone stood up and whooped as I clapped out a death march. They headed down our artificial aisle while we tossed Rice and a few slinkies, then we all headed towards a picnic table full of strawberries, cake and salmon.

Suddenly a traveling quartet arrived. No one claimed them for the wedding, but they trailed up to us anyway. Someone laughed earnestly that this was the bride's French gypsy roots bringing some home with solemn symbols crashing and dancing. The oompah loompah band danced forward and stopped in front of the couple. No one was speechless and we talked over their looks.

The oompa-loomps band jawed and jeered thick horn drawls and hard drum beats at us. We watched wide eyed, smiling and puzzled. The finale was a ten second free jazz sax solo, then their hands on their knees with wide eyes, almost in tears.

((Perhaps play untitled by neutral milk hotel))

Their ring leader, Thin man Dan walked out in front of us. I knew him from playing a few shows here and there around Brooklyn. He was a tall pencil head who played a tenor sax like a gift teasing us. The band quieted their harmonies until it was only him playing. He did a jig soloing to the air, and all at once stopped suddenly. We all clapped profusely at his talent and beret.

((The tight jeans))

"Friends!" He raised his arms. "We don't know you but applaud this hefty wager you're playing with life. We're all with you, but we're gambling just by throwing in our hats," he tipped his dusty top hat off. It landed with a tiny crunch on the grass. Dan paused. A few people glanced at the hat then back at him. "Shakespeare once said in a mixed review play" he bellowed "'All the world is a stage! You get hitched and life's a bitch!' So please let us be your audience and see through it that you have a happy ending."

He lowered his hands and presented them to the couple, "Congratulations!"

Everyone hurled a few hurrahs and shook hands. The bride's rich parents fluttered towards the food tables and the younger crowd lazily followed. The fare was fairly better than the usual fodder, cellophane unwrapped delicately. Some drinks were poured and everyone's brains started to get lubed up in the middle of the afternoon.

It turned out Renee knew many people here for years. Marty was an ex-boyfriend and former singer of a sellout band now heading North to work in a hemp factory he's a nice guy you'd like him for sure. Another friend she fell out of touch with because of a cold war relationship in their English class in University.

"Evangeline!" Renee exclaimed.

Conversations built on solid partial memories and strong Hey!s became brittle. Feeling like a trophy hanging limply from a hand, I idled away around the park and sulked against a tree. In a nearby shop I almost bought a cookbook, but I could be moving soon so I didn't. My forehead shined and glazed in the bit of sun that made it through that cloudy day.

Another game of boce started up, and the old Italians measured the balls carefully. In the near distance blurred distance tight jeans intermingled with clad steampunk dresses. Renee very slowly walked over to me, and I looked up at her.

"Hey, whatcha doin there?" Renee stood over me.

I sat silent, watching the dry fall leaves blow between us. Finally I looked up into her face, but mostly her hair.

She sequined her words into a fashionable sing song "When are we getting married, Om?"














----

That day I stared into Renee's eyes, and her into mine. I wasn't sure what I saw, or was supposed to see. They were like any others, and it wasn't like I could stare into eyes that long anyway. I guess it was a boon, really. When you can stare and no one is offended, or aggravated, or aggitated or uncomfortable. I imagine it used to be that everyone was allowed to stare into the other's eyes until they realized they loved them, meant something to them or weren't dead yet. I stared into Renee's eyes and I watched my fisheyed reflection watching back at me. One thing I didn't expect was to find myself in there, especially since people usually move too much to notice that.

We both knew the answer but were completely ignorant about it.((?))
