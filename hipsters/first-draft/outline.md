Themes:
- Changing mind from indifference and inaction to action
- Loneliness
- If you want something yuo need to be an active part of it
- Talk is cheap

Tour: A thing he sets to do but puts no effort towards, sabotaging himself and making it unacheivable.

Visa: A thing he has no control over but decides to live under because it's an excuse to stay, easier than to leave.

meditating: Useless without purpose

family: Enforce some sort of values

All people except family: re-enforce same lie to eachother

Prof:

Jack and Ryan: Echoes of indifference

Gabby:
