CHAPTER 3 establish rough relaionship with father

Haytham called again. 

"Yea?"

He coughed some static into the phone then replied quite loudly, "Hey son! Long time no talking!" He always spoke to me on the phone in English.

"Hi Dad."

"How's the NEW YORK?"

"Better than the old one."

"Ah, as GOOD or BETTER?"

"Better." I replied.

"Ok, that's great. You enjoying it there computer scientist?"

"Enjoying it, is that the question? It's hard here."

I could hear my Dad breathe heavy into the phone, a bit out of breathe. Which was weird because he never exercised.

"Did you run or something Dad?"

"Yes son, I did run. I'm always running everywhere getting things for the family."



"Do you want to talk to your mother?"

"I kind of have to go though I'm busy right now."

"I see son. You are busy."

"I'll call her later seriously. You can't imagine what it's like here."

"Ok, well let us know son, we are waiting."

I nodded in the right places and waited. A few I love you's were exchanged, and we hung up. I hung up first.
