I was almost back at my apartment, maybe a few blocks away. 

"Om!" Renee yelled behind me.

I really wanted any of it to mean anything. It tried to make anyof it bleed, but it was cold. It was a cold cold world and the hope dies on contact when any asshole mumbles for a light.

"Do you have one?" Renee asked me.

"I don't carry them in my pocket anymore."

"I guess that makes sense." she said, slightly backhanded with a chuckle.

"Have you tried," I spoke slowly, approaching the jab tenderly, "actually buying something with money you earned?"

She decided not to respond and we continued in silence. We could feel the deep disdain; a huge cavern. You could make some pretty sweet echoes in there.

"What's this supposed to be now?" She asked.

She leaned in. "If you got the letter." she whispered, her eyes widening, her smile toothening, "then what?"

"Then I'd shoot myself." I told her blankly. "I'd shoot myself in the head with the letter. It's dangerous."

She laughed even though I doubt she understood and exagerated a shrug with a smug look, "not here."




"You know I'm changing too, if you're thinking that can't happen. I may move back west. It's a big decision."

Renee and I strolled angrily towards our apartment in silence. As we crossed the large parking lot though Renee changed her expression, Prof was coming back towards us. "Hi Prof, how's it going?" He smiled and waved back, but then stopped suddenly in front of us. A jerky jerk.

Prof suddenly turned withered, depleted, a bit drunk and angry. He decomposed in front of us rapidly like a drying leaf in a vaccuum. "I talked to Gabby, do you remember my ex-girlfriend?" he yelled at the top of his lungs, "and three years ago, THREE YEARS AGO, you took what was mine." His body flailed and shook. Prof pointed his finger hard at me. "She asked you for a fucking letter, a letter. They sent it to ME, do you fucking remember?!"

Renee's eyes were wide open we pair were both thoroughly confused. I barely remembered Gaby. Girly, thick accented, lost look in her eyes. Prof woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you." She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

I tried to think back, three years ago. Visiting Prof's house at any time was very uneventful. Prof used to live in a house off campus with a few randoms. Equipped with two floors and a basement, it felt massive. He remembered the kitchen. Fruit flies swam endlessly in circles over the sink, milk jugs in the fridge with just a bit of rotting milk skimming the bottom. One roommate had a neglected pug they were always furious at. Because it shat on their beds whenever it could becasue they rarely walked it.

I thought for a moment, "No, I don't th--"

"LIAR!" He screamed at the top of his lungs, "YOU are A FUCKING LIAR! You're an awful fucking person. You remember she ASKED YOU? You came to my house and she ASKED you to take it. She TOLD ME." He started to tense up, and Renee stepped back.

"I really don't remember, this was three years ago? Did something happen abou-"

"THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT ASSHOLE, You fucking took that letter from ME, from MY ROOM. YOU INVADED MY PRIVACY, YOU FUCK."

"Prof calm down!" Renee yelled, now half concerned half laughing, queerly intent on what looked like the beginning of a fight. A vein or two appeared on Prof's neck and/or forehead or whatever.

"Wait, what was this for? What is this letter?"

"It was her visa so she could stay in the country." Prof hissed.

I tried really hard to remember what I did, and suddenly manifested in my mind an image of grabbing something from the top of a pile of papers. I remembered the request now from Gaby. I remembered I found it odd because she never asked anything of me. The only thing that bound us together was our flakey friends at the time.

"Prof, oh my God I'm sorry, I didn't even think about it, I'm so sorry. But she needed that to stay in the country, no? Were you even dating her th-"

"You violated my privacy," Prof steamed, very pale. "You dented my blood. I was going to use that letter to confront her. But you fucked that up. You fucking asshole, I will NEVER forgive you. You CROSSED ME." And Prof charged at me, throwing a punch in my stomach. It wasn't hard, but the shock was. I felt violated somehow. Prof walked right through me and didn't look back.

"What the hell Prof?!" Renee shrieked, but Prof kept going. I took a step back and tried to understand if I was hurt. At that moment my temper shot up like Renee's ex, and I bellowed a scream. "You idiot?! You think you got some kind of revenge? Over some kind of stupid plan you- THREE YEARS AGO?! You moron! I apologized and you still hit me!"

But Prof marched on, standing up taller now, shoulders straight. Prof slowly faded, saying nothing.

"Do you feel good now?! You feel you won something? You coward! Come back and fight this stupid fight like a real man you idiot! ANGUS!"

Renee told me to shut up. Prof turned a corner and escaped from us. Renee whispered, "You know, you deserve that."

A second shock overcame me, "What?!" I shot her a hard look, but it couldn't penetrate anything.

"You know why. He's right, he's a better person than you. You're wrong about so many things but you just don't see it. You're not a nice guy, you need to know that." Her words stood in the air, dancing and stomping hard on my head, then crashed a car into it, sending it hurtling off a cliff. In angry awe I mulled these words over in my mouth like a baby's challenge and finally started caring enough to hate her.

"Are you for real?! Is this real life? Do you understand what just fucking happened here?! Do you _understand_?"

"PERFECTLY. EVERYTHING IS _FUCKING_ CLEAR. Look at _me_, I've overcome so much. He's right." And suddenly she marched home in what I only assumed was some kind of twisted convinced frustration. I stood there in shock.

"You think you're a fucking Pariah? You think you're prudent?"

"Prudent?" I paused, "PRUDENT?"

"You think you're a fucking, nice guy? You're an awful person."

"PRUDENT?!" I pronounced slowly in disbelief.



"COME _ON_" She ushered, "COME the fuck _ON_. Let's go _home_."

"You don't get your stuff. You don't get your stupid dishes that you never even used."

"They're not yours!" she yelled out.
