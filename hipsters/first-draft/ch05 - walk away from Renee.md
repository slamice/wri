CHAPTER 5

A few days later Selina virtually hit me up for a coffee ((headache)) that night. "Hello fellow human!" She cheerfully gleed at me through the phone. Selina didn't think "you guys" made any feministic sense, so she opted for "Hello kindly people" and "Greetings fellow homosapiens."

"What's up?"

"You should come out." she whispered, "I'm at Cup O'Joe."

"At the coffee shop?"

"A cough-ee-shop?"

"Are you high?"

"I may be high. It is a definite possibility."

"I'll venture out."

And I hung up.

It sure was better than a night with Renee and an eigthies Romcom. I sacked on a pair of jeans, ignoring her critical looks. "I need to go out." I told her, "I'm meeting up with Selina."

"You never stay home anymore with me." Renee puttered. "Or are you meeting another girl to stay home with?"

"It'll only be for a bit. There is no other girl."

"Do you like Selina?"

"Please not again. Please."

"Can you get me a latte then? French roast."

"Sure."

I couldn't and still can't count the number of times I walked up and down those streets. I could point to where I found five dollars in change, where various throw up was spewed. Constructions laid out, miserably distorted. An oven left to starve on the side of the road, not before they stuffed it with empty bottles yet to be recycled.

I remember that night distinctly because it was like any other night. The cold tried to creep into my jacket, into my pants. The down and out bars hid in the shadows of construction. Cool as they were, they served mac and cheese types of things but little else. There were no windows so I couldn't see the people potentially dying from such a fire hazard inside. The two sushi places on the way I passed were idly populated. A bit further along, the projects were trying to project on to me, non discreet and brooding. The people who lived there almost all had projects. Brutal two day jobs, brutal childcare for their oh so many children and brutal laziness. Distanced, there were convenient stores far too expensive to be convenient. The arrangement was all a maze of zoning left over from a previous era.

A few girls sexed by me, some in tattered jeans, others in what looked like just shirts, shorts hidden in the midst. I was disgusted to think so, but hardly guilty. Also there was a native homeless lady selling original symmetric artwork. She yelled twenty for each piece and I wondered if it was offensive that someone tried to talk her down to five.

A cow hummed in my pocket and it was my father. Crawling over my phone was his number, so I hesitated a bit. The mistakable conversations we had with each other were not riveting and were very brief. The surprise came when any of them lasted longer than 10 minutes. Our relationship could be taken lightly with a few exclaimations, barely a few grams.

"Hey son! Tall guy!" His voice thundered fuzzing the sound through the phone.

"Hi Dad."

"How you doin?" Long time son!"

"I guess, yea."

"How's your life how's your job?"

"They're ok, doing good."

"Listen son, when do you think you can come back, just visit for a week?"

"I don't know if that's possible Dad. You know I can't go back my visa status hans't gone through yet."

"Oh really? Should be soon right son?"

I leaned against a wall wit my back to it. My eyes closed and imagined my Dad on the other end, then I imagined a beautiful blonde curly haired girl, her face slightly red because she was dutch and because her genetics were tickled by the cold streaming into her shirt that cover her bellybutton. My Dad's voice faded back in but barely.

"----'s Son got it in three week's, you remember them? I don't know how many years it's been since you applied."

"Only five. I don't know when I'll get it but I have to wait for it."

"I see son. It's too bad your brother and sister will be here."

"Yes I know. But if I leave I can't come back."

"Ok I see. It's no problem son. Let me know, let me know if you can come."

"I will Dad."

"You need anything son?"

"No I don't need anything Dad, I'm fine for now."

"Ok well love you son, bye. Good bye." 

"Bye."

"Goodbye" he said, and hung up.

At about that time I paced myself slower trying to time how late I'd be. I remember going in a haze, the buildings around me didn't exist as I stared at the ground or nothing. That's when I lifted a penny off the world and put the grimy thing in my pocket. This was money on the ground, pure value. Over the years I made quite a heap. Probably around sixty dollars. The change was all in a small jar. I never really felt I needed it though. It's the one thing I don't leave someone. Because no one wants the small, immediate minute pennies.

It was late but the dark cafe was still pretty active with many designers and artists slumped over tables and couches. Some yawned out conversations, others whooped mildly as they played risk in corners.

Selina's eyes were at half mast with a very visible hazy red in their corners "I got high with Jeremy tonight." She gleamed.

"How's that going?" I concerned as bitterly as my gingerbread coffee.

"I don't know, what do you think of him?"

"I don't know him."

"He's a good guy, you'd like him." Every other word from Selina was lightly hurkled with a distant tired smile. "He's a university radio station coordinator. His friend works at Happy Blue Cat so we got to watch so many old documentaries. Rare ones about doctors in the sixties and bikes."

"Like stunt bikes?"

"All kinds of bikes. Hmm." And then, "Are you alright?"

"I'm totally fine. Absolutely nothing happened."

"How's Renee? She never comes out."

"Yea she's not feeling too well tonight."

"Oh what's wrong?"

"Well we don't know exactly but her mono is acting up again." I shifted in my seat uncomfortably. Our conversation breaks were laggy but not substantial.

I pushed the envelope and the coffee mug against my cheek.

"What are you doing?"

"It keeps me warm. Warm cheekies. I don't even like coffee."

An eyebrow raised a chuckle, "then why order coffee?"

"A latte is thicker so it'll keep me warmer."

I drank it as my head slowly began to hurt. The milk was heavy and felt heavy going down, would be heavy on my way home and when I went to bed. And when I woke up the heaviness woulc be there to weigh down the rest of my day.

"Adrian's not working tonight looks like."

"She's playing tonight. At the Claybourne Whatever. It's the new place near Main and Clinton." slowly coming down from her high.

"Yea I heard about it. She plays a lot."

"You don't want to go? I'd totally be up for it."

Selina shrugged, "kind of, but wanted to take it easy tonight. Take it easy."

On my way out I ordered Renee's latte. Selina's haze started to brighten up, 


((Start to talk about potential marriage to Renee))

The detour I took on my way back was long. I went through a village of modern apartments complexes, still deserted. Apartments that were half finished had already been bought. The concreate jutted to the sky. I wondered for a moment what it was like to live on the top floor, to live on any floor. Soon there'll be rich toddlers. There'll be yoga pants. There'll be dogs running around everywhere here too. Dogs. My coworkers would love these places. Basterdized Bauhaus. The same sky's they'd be under has been around longer than birds, but to the new residents it'll be a nice touch and a simple distraction from what they needed to do to need to do.

I leaned against a giant metallic bird statue only a larger metallic mother bird statue could love. I sipped Renee's latte, the ice melting inside it as my hand warmed it. I looked up and tried to find a star while under all the street lamps.

I hummed a soft sylable in a bass, my eyes still closed, forgetting the world. I could still hear the wind so I tried to shut it out. And the street cars. And the silence. I thought about what I was looking for.

But the latte was cold now and getting colder and wondered where it was, so I had to save it.

A couple walked by me holding hands like people who still held hands. They were deftly upsetting and rearranged my stomach accordingly.

Honestly my mother was just there, and I loved her. But really, we grew apart just like I grew apart from the rest of my family. She was cautious and protective but once I hit a certain age all that stopped. Maybe she figured I'd do what she did, so phrases became stuff like, "do your best." and "Have fun." The first two years away from home I took nothing she said in the past or that present seriously because I hated her for reasons I can't explain. And then after that I realized all the lies I made up in my head were just that. So I got over them and we talked intermittently when she reminded me to talk. Now the thought of her sick, even if it wasn't serious, opened a locked box. I wondered how much longer I could stay indifferent.

On my way back I passed by Jack and Andy's apartment and noticed the light was on. A fever of rage suddenly overtook me on my walk back. Who was Andrew. Such a bastard. And suddenly I was in my apartment, sneaking a look at Renee saying Hi, but she didn't look up. I poured her latte into a glass and heated it up. Only half of it filled up the glass. Still she was completely embossed on the bed, engrossed.

I immediately went back out, making sure the cat didn't escape. Just around the corner, under our bedroom window, I tilted Renee's forgotten latte and dumped it in slow motion. The stream made a quick splash and settled in the cracks of concrete. Once the glass was fully empty, I lurched back up the stairs to the apartment.



(Completely forgot she ordered one.)




























































Time drags on. He shuffles his feet, wondering how he got here. He recalls his family, how his mother hated Lebanon and how his father loved it. Also how his brothers were there. Then moved him happily overseas. The feeling he gets when he arrives at college is freedom, and he begins drinking. He meets Ryan in his dorm.

Om feels disengaged and tired. The point of the chapter is to show how Om has whittled down. Apart from band practice and work, he stays home. He goes to bed earlier but wakes up the same time everyday. He hates thinking about the past but does it anyway. He remembers his silent parents. He recalls how much he hated highschool. He feels lonely. Selina is in the area and he meets up with her once. Coffee cup scene.

-------------------------------

That guy had to call me. Selina's Adrian's Steve's guy. I found myself pacing in my apartment and on subway platforms, like a child waiting for breakfast((analogy?)). I knew how to feel when they accepted. Even just an American tour would be great. I'd never been to the west coast. White villa Mexican houses. I'd never been to the midwest. Miles of driving in hot air.






























------------------

I'd drink but both halfs of my family were drunks. Some people say it's just that they were weak. But I can't take it. More than two beers and I'd probably be out. 

---------------------------

Mostly, those days, we kept to ourselves, Renee and I. 

Before all of this, Renee barely showed up to anything. There was some kind of mystery going on. was it drugs? Or her job? Or an incredible literate social circle who read books at home constantly?

I knew her ex-lover though. I knew Andrew almost too well. He was so articulate I was almost jealous until I hated him after I found out he sucked. Every live music venue featured him in the audience, and eventually we talked and we stoned until we were down and out all those nights. A person of the world, he persona'ed hard. His persona was gifted in being interested in many things nature until they aggravated him. Nature itself abused the world. Finally he restored through video games.


The words were mostly recollections though. How long had it been since we heard that song, and omg that band is featured in a zine now. After the party we settled in a playground. We took turns slumping in swings, climbing the jungle gym nonchalantly.

At one point it was Andrew, Anaj, Remy, myself, Sarah and Ryan. After a show we wondered apathetically.

Anaj opened, "Hey, do you ever wonder--"






Later we lived with them, Anaj and Remy. They turned out to be intensely disturbed. They chain smoked incessantly. Their cat coughed on me.

They gave us with food that was actually a bribe.



















------------

It was like any gentrified neighborhood I guess. The lack of




He worked at a coffeeshop we frequented on M--- street. It illuded to being a chain but was not really so.


Bookstores were still open, they're still open. Shelves full of slightly off famous books. The inside of the comic vintage one next door was rickety yet ironed out. A clean mess of leafed through comics were wrapped in plastic. Inside were people ready to save us from disasters that never happened, or from each other.


She spent most of her time being absent. Be it the drugs she took or the demeanor she appeared to have by not appearing. There was some kind of mystery going on, an incredibly attractive one I was a tiny bit hopeless to find out about.















When my family used to go on trips they were long ones. Back overseas. They were rare enough because of the money, but they were a plunge into chaos, more chaos than New York was. I was surprised anything besides restaurants functioned. The humidity mugged us.

My family was huge. It's impossible for me to recall any names further related to me than immediate cousins, aunts and uncles. Kisses were showered on me and the food was great.

At one point I was sent to a seiance with my older sister. My aunt became possessed by an angel and touched my hand. She told me, cryptically and in cut up sentences that I would have four children and be divorced, this was my future.

I left there sullen and disturbed. I could no better predict my future than an unsolved mystery, but I knew I'd never be married and never have kids. That's delluding yourself to think that is a good idea.















-------------


About then I had a reoccurring dream, one you've probably had. There was a cliff, and it didn't matter if the push from my parents or from ancient bullies, but it all happened

---------

I landed myself in a university far from my parents, or at least far enough to forget about hating them. My feelings about them fluctuated between pounding on things and thankfully being sent here alone as soon as they left after helping me move in.

















































The weather was much hotter in L______ because, I don't know it felt humid. We lived in Lebanon until my mom couldn't take it anymore. The traffic, the noise, the exhaust. Sometimes I thought my mother's eyebrow was permanently raised, disavowing all belief in pure chaos. The country didn't feel like it functioned, but moved like a wheel moves. Because it had to.

Until we moved to Canada. My brother, sister and I sighed relief into a vacant apartment.

My father's ear was glued to the phone. During an argument, during the seven day war, during a meal, in bed, even now. The phone was in his pocket twisted and insulted from all the shouting it endured.













------------

Most of the time the buildings don't exist. They disappear and the slow traffic and indifferent expressions toss me a few thoughts to juggle. They hit my face and stick for a bit then fall to the sidewalk.

My family

There's always a neglected penny everywhere. You can see them waiting for nothing, on platforms and sidewalks whistling. I pick every one of them up, whether washed in a sidewalk pool or peppered with black grit. All of them are pocketed, put in a jar and carried back shaking and fumbling on top of each other in desperation.


-------------


Notable that Om picks up pennies wherever he goes.


---------------




A show was playing that night. I customarily sat in the corner, yawning and watching people. I chatted briefly with a few I knew, who I met a few times but never socialized with. Hello. Yea I don't know where she is. She usually works these nights. I shifted and shrugged aimlessly, but slowly.

The room swam in ill lit grafitti. A wood stage with peeling and chipped paint. Everyone there, all of us, we died and died and died. As we waited we died and it was so depressing I wanted to choke the atmosphere. Grab it's throat and kill this mandess and kick the devil out of it. But the devil never surfaces and hides under teh venues slats, our fingernails. So exhausted.

The devil was killing us laughing at us and rolling in our flith but slowly. A lice ((singular for lice?)) sucking our thoughts bathing in dandruff.

Suddenly we stared for a moment at the players as they detuned everything. The loudness quieted for loudness and they broke the air with swears and with the power of absolutely horrible guitar playing. The performers came on and definitely performed somehow. No amount of minimalism saved them, every note individually was scrunched together and thrown away, then smothered with a deaf singer's coughs.

They all loved it.




------------

"Take some of the money that you have, and buy yourself some class. Did you give me advance notice when you fired me?"


-------------






Sometimes I skipped the train. After throwing away work, adding more work, shuffling work, I threw a few goodbyes back as I walked out the door. I walked over the hot sidewalk grills, feeling the damp warm air on some of them and then bland stale air above others. Everyone rushed and stood cramped in subway cars underneath me, all buried together, while I walked above them, free, with air. The walks were usually brisk and clean.

Mostly the streets were useless, famished for something alive as I walked by. Alley after alley was empty save bits of people and trash. But if you'd look closer, and a glimpse into an apartment window with a huge bare breasted lady or a man wambling with his dog made it feel like the blocks had some life. But these people were beaten down a while ago. The night, the polluted ocean of water and hurtful words, the boxes they lived in. The city never sleeps but everyone is always tired.








I sometimes forgot the sun existed in New York. It didn't mean as much to me but I felt it should have. I desperately wanted to love it. I wanted to love the bizarre alleys. Sometimes I asked age old shop owners selling nothing but rare instruments, shelves full of trinkets no one bought, thick oily pastries dying to be loved... How they did it everyday and why they did it every single day. There were no smiles behind the whispy beards, behind the grey stubbles or their glazed wrinkled eyes. Some ignored me, but mostly they whispered "I don't know". I don't know.





It was pretty silent in the apartment mostly.

The parties turned me off, and I began declining to go to them. Over the course of a few months I slowly started resisting to go out with anyone except band practice with Selina and a few shows sprinkled between them. Work was a chore. I booked it reasonably every chance I got. It was pretty easy with Renee, she barely made it out to dinners with her friends. The nights we stayed home I cooked, always an inviting challenge to cook a dinner with only four ingredients with no spices and somehow make it flavorful.

That apartment grew smaller. I don't remember too much from those days. I guess it was more about _what_ I remembered those days.

I remember my mother's yogurt soup and Khash. The bread carts. The countless electrical wires above the streets. All the skirmishes. My dad, constantly on the phone. The instability. The made up girls. The phone glued to his head. My brother and sister shouting at each other. The final move to Canada. My final move to the US.






Before I knew it I missed the few months I brushed off, as usual. Not because they meant something, but because I wasted them.
