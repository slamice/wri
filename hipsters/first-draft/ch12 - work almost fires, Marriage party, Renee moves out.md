Chapter 12

Mik's office was cubed off in a corner with designer clout and magic. Truly a proud achievement of corporate culture on the march of progress. One Friday morning he called me in to be an obstruction.

We chatted about Mik's family and work gossip, and the morning light brightened our conversation with happy notes. It was closely followed by coffees and teas and toast and jam and kids laughing and subtle nuances. All of it was going down a long disgusting wholesome drain.

"Mind closing the door for a second?"

Quickly all his jokes vanished, scurrying scared into all nooks of the room then out the door before it shut. Mik's skin somehow paled further, an incredible feat for a native Belgian. His eyes grew sunk in and hollowed out. His stare told me You Need to Love What You Do. YNTWYD.

"Maybe we should talk about you."

"I know I can do this." I forced a timid smile to my lips. I practiced it in the mirror a few times in case a day like that would come, but it failed me.

"The longer you take to figure that out the more time you're wasting. And not just your time." He was staring at me dead on, I was so surprised by it I barely noticed his shoulder shrug. He smiled back at me unapologetically. I wondered if he enjoyed our entire talk earlier revealing itself to be a sham.

"How about we give it a month? That's plenty of time right? We can talk then."

I took a deep look out the window, and again he smiled, "a month, right? Let's see."

Walking back to my desk, my chest heaved a sigh. All the holed jeans and lattes the world chugged out were thrown to the floor. The company's pathetic cups and free snacks waded down a stream. They were tasteless garbage. Nauseous, my anxieties played me as the words and symbols danced the rest of the day around my screen. Only then did I notice the background; a picture of an intimidating mountain top.

In the office bathroom after a tasteless lunch. The mirror was speckled with dust and bits of floss aftermath. A headache stirred up, my mind reeled it in slowly until it nestled snug right behind my immediate thoughts.

I waved at the faucet to spray out a tiny cold shower. Each drop threw itself dying on my hands, rolling dead down the drain. Maybe I'd dilute my shock with Michael, he wouldn't understand but he'd listen. That's not what happened, anyway.

A coffee run excuse could work, but when I approached his desk he was hunched over, in such a deep foreboding mood that it made me guess his age again. His fingers heavily smashed down each key to a black & white screen messed with text. It was a clear sign of frustration to remove all the syntactical sugar, the rainbow of colors that highlighted special parts of the code to aid in development. His workplace was stripped completely to a bare nothing at all to make things cleaner and run faster. I then noticed, besides his jacket, piles of notes thrown out in some desperate plea to start over.

I was seconds away from tapping him on either shoulder but, in a sudden rage, he erected himself furiously to the ceiling and tore the laptop from its cords. He slammed it on the desk again and again, spitting out fuckword after fuckword. A few pieces of the machine and his curses flew to the floor, and neighboring cubicle-ers hid behind their walls, peeking. He walked out miserable right by me to the exit. His laptop lay in a mildly unpleasant electronic heap, a box with a broken frame.

He stod over it all, defeated and tried.

We all stared at his leave in confusion. I thought briefly about following him with the crowd but no one else did. The entire office simply looked at eachother, mulling over the scene. Slowly the sounds of typing started up, and they forgot.

I gave him a few minutes then found him outside, looking up at the sky with what was probably his second cigarette. "How bad was it?" He spoke quietly, smoke danced above his shaking hand.

"It was basically like watching a one sided fight."

"I'm resigning obviously."

"For what?"

"For what."

We lay (leaned) against the concrete and watched the people rush by, our hearts hanging in our throats. I wondered what those people wanted? The lady with the stroller, an angry lawyer, a skateboarder as they disappeared behind corners into oblivion. And then again a thousand others appeared in their place.

"Maybe," hmm... "Maybe you have to redefine what winning means?"

His eyes finally met mine, a long look that got longer, "Winning doesn't mean anything anymore."

"What do you want to do?"

He breathed out heavily and I mimicked him.

"I _didn't want_ to change Om. But I gave up a piece of myself to be here. I had no choice but, maybe it was a mistake."

((I could tell the way he smashed his laptop that it also took a chunk out of him.))

The rest of the day slogged. Two weeks later Michael was gone.

...

That weekend Renee walked to a park for a wedding and towed me along. The bride to be worked with Renee briefly relabeling expired medicine. They had coffee a few times and she slipped in an invitation. We were familiar with everyone else going too, not all by name but barely by face. They were extras in parties either of us frequented.

Saturday early winter weather nipped at us while afternoon traffic kept us company on our way there. As we began to we walk we began to enjoy our silence. Unfortunately halfway there she reached for my hand and held it firmly, as if anticipating a jailbreak.

The ceremony took place in a small park by swings and bocce fields but just far enough to avoid interrupting a game. There were enough picnic tables for the thirty or so of us. The food waited patiently under plastic, but the people were already antsy at the half an hour late laggers.

We could see a few of the elders wore suits but most knew better. Renee's ladybug skirt leggings bunched at her knees. I wore a casual button up with rolled up sleeves, but only because I forgot one of the buttons were missing.

The bride's parents were fidgeting. Her mother's spidery brooch slowly ate at her black shirt jacket, but she didn't notice because her nose was pulled shamelessly so high up to the sky by a fish hook. She shook, smiling and distraught for her daughter. Her face and wrinkled forehead plush was on thick. Her father was just as decorated. He was too distracted counting the unmet expectations around him. I felt a kinship grow towards him throughout the day.

	The modern couple bore exact resemblance to each other holistically. They met on a boat to Governors Island eight years ago. Their dreams together were spent in cafes, camping and back in her French hometown. She accentuated every mutilated English word and he drank them all in, a bit dripping into his beard. 

	The sun was out and some birds chirped, which was nice but not helping. The priest put down his beer and settled on the podium, which was a stand for bocce players to keep their score. He began his sermon raging socio-political arguments at the church. A few 'likes' and 'hmm's were thrown in for good measure, all the while the couple smiled into each other's faces.

	"... And on this beautiful day, who can say that they don't fight with all our hearts and souls for one another? Let the floodgates of peace and prosperity open up and crash down on this couple. They're now ready to brave the storm of True Matrimony(TM).

	And isn't this matrimony? Isn't this some sweet holy stuff?"

	I remember the kiss was as passionate as Renee's cold cheek on my shoulder was. Her hand was on my other shoulder. I stayed put but felt worse than being broke. 

	The ceremony lasted roughly ten minutes. Everyone stood up and whooped as I clapped out a death march. They walked down the artificial aisle while we tossed rice and a few slinkies, then we all headed towards a picnic table full of strawberries, cake and smoked salmon sandwich halves.

	But before we made it to the table, a stint of notes called us from across the field. Suddenly, a traveling quartet arrived. No one claimed them for the wedding, but they trailed up to us anyway. Someone laughed earnestly that this was the bride's French gypsy roots bringing some of her history home with solemn symbol crashing and jerky dancing.

	The oompah loompah band flounced forward and stopped in front of the couple. No one was speechless and we talked over their looks. The band jawed and jeered thick horn drawls and hard drum beats at us. Their ringleader, Thin Man Dan walked out in front of them. I knew him from playing a few shows here and there around Brooklyn. He was a tall pencil head who played tenor sax like a bad gift. The band quieted their harmonies until it was only him playing. He did a jig with a ten second solo free jazz finale. Then finally all tooted their last together as we all clapped profusely at their talents and many berets.

	"Friends!" Thin Man Dan raised his arms. "We don't know you but applaud this hefty wager you're playing with life. We're all for you, and we're gambling just by throwing in our hats," he tipped his dusty top hat off and it landed with a tiny crunch on the grass. A few people glanced at the hat then back at him.

	"Shakespeare once said in a mixed review play" he bellowed, addressing the couple, "'All the world is a stage! You get hitched and life's a bitch!' So please let us all be your audience and see through it that you have a happy ending."

	He lowered his hands and presented them to the couple, "Congratulations!"

	Everyone hurled a few hurrahs and they shook hands. The bride's rich parents fluttered back towards the food tables and the younger crowd lazily followed. They began unwrapping the cellophane delicately, commenting on how the fare was fairly better than usual wedding fodder. Some drinks were poured and everyone's brains started lubing up to the middle afternoon.

	Renee started engaging in chipper conversations but I broke off. My heart wasn't into feeling like a trophy hanging limply from a hand. I idled away around the park finally sulking against a tree. My forehead shined and glazed until the sun finally shied away behind the clouds.

	A game of bocce started up in front of me, and the old Italians were fully charged. They were so animated, men in their eighties breaking sweats yelling at each other over tiny inches. I remember wondering what yelling was for anymore as a familiar feeling gurgled in my stomach.

	In the near distance I could still see tight jeans and skirts intermingling. One broke off slowly drifting towards me.

	"Hey, whatcha doin there?"

	I sat silent, watching the dry fall leaves blow between our feet. Finally I looked up into her face, but mostly her hair.

	She sequined her words into a fashionable sing song "When are we getting married, Om?"

That day I stared into Renee's eyes, and her into mine. I wasn't sure what I saw, or was supposed to see. They were like any others, and it wasn't like I could stare into eyes that long anyway. I guess it was a boon, really. When you can stare and no one is offended, or aggravated, or aggitated or uncomfortable. I imagine it used to be that everyone was allowed to stare into the other's eyes until they realized they loved them, meant something to them or weren't dead yet. I stared into Renee's eyes and I watched my fisheyed reflection watching back at me. One thing I didn't expect was to find myself in there, especially since people usually move too much to notice that.

We both knew the answer but were completely ignorant about it.((?))

It turned out Renee knew many people here for years. Marty was an ex-boyfriend and former singer of a sellout band now heading North to work in a hemp factory he's a nice guy you'd like him for sure. Another friend she fell out of touch with because of a cold war relationship in their English class in University.

"Evangeline!" Renee exclaimed.
