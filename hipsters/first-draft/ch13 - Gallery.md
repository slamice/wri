Chapter 13

Renee moved out shortly after that. I helped her pack and hid the records we bought together that I wanted. Through the whole thing the cat took refuge under the bed like it did with every fight. But it must have mistook the situation, because teh choice was undeniable and after it was done, inevitable.

After two movers we contacted that day bailed on us, a desperate hail to Marley came through and she swung by to pick Renee's things up. Most everything was hers. There were boxes from her childhood back to pictures from when she was five years old. Pictures I chose not to look through. Half finished scrap books, sticker books, coloring books, everything a child could have wanted. They were all loaded in the back of Marley's car, and it took three trips to deliver them to her house.

The goodbye's were mutual, and we were too tired to fight. With the cat boxed up and the car running, we hugged out a goodbye and 

I worked my ass off from then on out.

Things start to lighten up at work.

I worked daily then, maybe nightly. When I wasn't busy I tried to look it, and then took extra care in looking non chalant about it. I bought cufflinks for the first time.




Jack invited everyone he knew for the opening at the Bridget Donahue Gallery. It was a real gallery with real ambitions.












I thought I wouldn't notice the skyline after a million trips back and forth into Manhattan, but it grimly reminded me as the train rolled into the island over the bridge. I felt the buildings pierce into my gut, the higher the building the deeper it went in. Combined with the rest of the stress from work, I aimed for this to be a relaxing time but I was bullish on getting through it. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't read. I couldn't ((masturbate)) ((maybe too much?)) thinking of Gala or anyone. It was a horrific experience.

I got off at some station. A completely ambiguous one that tried not to point out all its faults. I walked from there, through the dead of wall street, past Manhattan's town hall. The cars slushing the slush in the streets and my shoes gently coddling the snow under my feet was my soundtrack as I lumbered over tenderly to the gallery that Jack was premiering.

The wine was flowing generously from the entrance table as the ladies took my attendance and my money, offering me a glass. I rejected thoughtfully.

The crowd were as expected. No one was out of place, svelt coats too expensive for the bodies. I even saw a faux fur hat woman in the audience laughing hysterically to every man in the room. The men were sauntry, young, oh so intelligent with firm beliefs buried in themselves. I vaguely recognized almost everyone. The empire state twisted in my chest and my heart gave out hope. Who was I and why was this important.

I walked around nervously trying to distract myself. The peices stuck on the wall, irrevocably so. They were animated with objects jutting out of them, bumps and ridges and cardboard and social norms to destroy I guess. One had a knife stuck straight through it. ~Why was destruction so important.~ Why did the artist want his peice to die.






I was having a hard time looking at the walls while I was distracted with all the talk. I forfeited my objective perspective with some nodding.












"I'm a bit surprised Prof isn't here."

"Prof. Prof is pissed. He left early this morning spitting out swears like a lunatic."

"Why is he so pissed?"

"I don't know honestly. He didn't sleep at our place last night but came back at around seven in the morning kicking stuff over until I told him to stop. He was being an _asshole_ but I didn't uninvite him. Whatever he's got issues let him get over them."

"Renee was in here I'm guessing?"

"Yea she came for a bit, is it still awkward? You trying to avoid her?"

"Everything is awkward" I puttered.

Behind Jack was his corner I recognized some of Jack's staple pieces. And next to those was tiny black writing on little white plaques.


"He discovered me in .... Gave me my drugs, qualudes."

The man in the corner, humbled with a blazer, spoke to a few beret'd critics ((cliches for the people trying not to be cliches)) waving his hands to the walls and farting a bit. Little Sarah was there, listening attentively, almost flanking his arm, teetering on the balls of her feet like a kid.




I looked in all three rooms for Gala. Maybe she hadn't arrived yet, even though Jack said he invited her after I casually asked without wanting to push the question.
