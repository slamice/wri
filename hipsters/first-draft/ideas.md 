- Examining nature of Loneliness

- Self is overrated

- Religion cannot rest independently from real life, real life is not independant from belief (basic axioms)

- Taking accountability is imporant. Choosing to be smarter then you are, ignorance, priveledge, or self loathing just digs a deeper hole for yourself.

- Cannot escape your past, need to face it to resolve it.

- All a balance, now currently not played or too curated an experience to be actually balaced.
