Adrian parked on the street and we headed quietly towards Steve's house. A fair oodle of people were already inside. The place was barely furnished, toppled in and out of itself. The living room was a mattress, love seat and a short coffee table with papers and weed. We sat down next to these stranger underneath the projector.  Steve started up some indian music. His band, Boombastic, practically stole all these rhythms and put a beat to them.

This environment sat nicely with the rest of the people hanging out there, about fifteen more or so. All friends of his roommates or friends. They passed around some sort of blunt and pills I didn't recognize. I didn't bother to take either off their hands. Steve was hard at work entertaining Adrian and Hayden. His voice fit so well in the background I couldn't distinguish it at first when he turned to me, "Why don't you smoke up?"

"I'm not so sure I'd be happy with the results."

"I don't know man sometimes it's nice to find out what those are. But that's cool." I nodded at a few more things he said muffled by the music and the crowd, then he went back to Adrian and Hayden promptly.

Looking back, I remember not wondering about Renee. I remember staring at those faces, hazy through the smoke. Words drifting in the air next to them. They were cut up by the music and popped like bubbles as they spoke. Adrian's round face looked like a laughing cloud. My memory reduces Hayden was only to his fat nose getting high.

Selina grabbed me hard by the arm and let me to a corner and we got up, and led me to a corner. Her eyes were a bit bloodshot and half closed dreamily. She smirked like a thoroughly candied child. We didn't need to shout anymore and I smiled with her.

"Is this the after party or the after after party?"

"Hmmm..." she wondered, her lips thoroughly pushed up exaggerated, "Has kind of an after-after party feel. I think we skipped one." and then her eyes opened up fully and I could see her red cornea canals, "We NEED to get a show Steve."

"WE NEED TO GET A SHOW WITH STEVE."

"He's got so many connections and he's such a nice guy."

"Adrian barely knows him though."

"We could tour Europe with them Om." and then she whispered, "we could tour..."

"How?" after realizing she was serious.

"They have a record deal. We could piggy back off of them. It would be the greatest time of your life Om."

I thought about any possible complications.

"You'll get your visa by then! It's been years! Om! Om!" she stared me in the eyes, paused. Her hands started stuffing invisible scones and butter rolls in her mouth "Om Om Om." she laughed to infinity and I joined in for a bit. It was so stupid we never got tired of it.

We drifted to other parts of the party. I leaned against the wall and watched the room unfold. It and the people in it felt shruggy and benevolent, smoking away to a low psychedelic hymn ignoring each other moderately.

I sat around for a bit more. I peer at the girls, drinking up various brown liquids. Most in black and two in camo jackets. I think they're beautiful on the outside. I take a look at the boys, rolling weed and describing their lives.

A mustashio'ed man wearing a reggae mop leaned a few feet away from me in silence. I peered over at him.

"When did you get here?" I whispered to him.

He ignored me briefly, but then breathed out without looking at me "about half an hour ago I guess. I'm getting tired already."

"Yea I know what you mean." When I really didn't.

"It's getting pretty late." He sulked, then smiled at himself profoundly.

"I've been tired before I even got here." I chuckled truthfully, but it was impossible to know if he was listening. He didn't look at me yet or ever again and left it at that. He walked away straight faced, taking his bloodshot eyes with him. I mulled that over in my head, and I only heard silence above the muttering people and the droning music.

Parties like these were brutally exhausting without something substantial to dull me. Weed was usually the norm but light drinking was another option I took up. I never overindulged, but inhaled just enough to feel like it was working. Two beers were enough for me that night.

So I left Selina at the party and I walked home. My steps were slow and my direction was mostly aimless. I counted the buildings I passed and the people who stood outside the few clubs that remained open. I passed a native indian prostitute who puffed up her boobs into the hole of her v-neck. I passed by the many overnight parked cars. A couple, if they were that legitimately, startled me with their discreet argument as I passed by a random car.

I was sketched out, my hands were in my pockets, my right gripping my keys and flipping through them.
