Ch 14

The sting the gallery left me faded a few blocks in to the long walk home. Over the bridge, I took a long look at Manhattan. The jutting buildings stood there rigid, and as I left them they slowly slid out of my pierced gut. Arduous.

Maybe ten blocks away from my apartment, I check myself for music. Maybe a spare headphone or something hid in my pocket. But no music tonight. Much to my disdain the cacophony of Renee's voice sounded off behind me, "Om!"

I didn't turn around, but she absolutely knew it was me anyway. She knew my walk, my demeanor. She watched it leave and come back all shrugged out everyday for the last few years.

"Om my god!" she said, "I was looking for you."

It had only been a few weeks but she looked thinner. Her face was brighter, but that could have been from the makeup she wore for the first time in a year. I'd known her so long topless that her clothes made a bizarre statement. Almost alien, somehow more naked. But she looked good, under the distant street lights and lit moon behind the clouds.

"You were headed to Andrew's."

"No, I was headed to you."

"You're seeing Andrew."

"No," she said calmly, smiling. "I was coming to see you."

"This is why we can't have a conversation."

"Hey, seriously I did. You still have my dishes Om."

"You didn't want them."

"Well I need them now."

She had no box and didn't look like she was going to carry anything. I paused, trying to think of a rebuttal but coudln't, so I gave in. I looked up at anything, at the moon hiding behind the clouds. But I felt her smile still there, digging in to me. It felt fake, but maybe it wasn't. There was a possibility. I desperately wanted to believe in her, that's it. It seemed menial I know. But she was inviting and charming and charasmatic and rotten.

"You came on a Saturday night to get dishes?"

"Yea, I don't have a life. You don't have to rub it in."

Despite the cold, we walked back together a few paces away from eachother slowly in silence. Every so often we'd glance to make sure we were both going the same direction, but slowly a shitty gravity pulled us closer.

She interrupted it with "How about your visa?"

A chuckle came up from deep in my throat, but it was mixed with a two in the morning yawn. "You know I didn't get it."

"Maybe the limo people are hiding it."

"They'll need it with all the shady stuff they're probably doing."

She was next to me by then. "If you got the letter." she said, her eyes widening, her smile toothening, "Then what? Are you the king?"

"Then I'd shoot myself." I told her blankly. "I'd shoot myself in the head with the letter. It's dangerous."

She laughed even though I doubt she understood.

"I'm sorry Om. It wasn't a good time."

"It's okay, I'm sorry too."

The limo dispatch was lit up and within sight as we walked. We could hear the hard snow crunch and crack under our weight.

"You know I'm changing too, even if you're thinking that can't happen."

"Yea well, lots of things can happen."

"I may move back to Seattle. It's a big decision."

"You don't like the city anymore."

"I'm fine with the city. I LOVE the city. The city never liked me."

A vape instantly appeared hanging from her mouth, and she smoked her typical raspberry. She blew the vapor into the air above us and we watched it evaporate. She was not much of a femme fatale though, just a fatale. Her hand brushed mine a few times until we snuck them in an embrace before they realized it. T remained peaceful for a few moments. I'm sure they were moments somewhere.

As we crossed the large parking lot though Renee and I noticed Prof coming towards us. "Hi Prof, how's it going?" He frowned, waved back and continued on. ((A jerky jerk.))

But suddenly a minute later we heard him yell and and we turned around. Admittedly he may have been a bit drunk or angry, but I don't think so. He looked white, withered, depleted. He apprached us and decomposed in front of us rapidly like a drying leaf in a vaccuum into some kind of growling mumbler.

Then, "I talked to Gala, do you remember my ex-girlfriend?" he yelled at the top of his lungs, "and three years ago, THREE YEARS AGO, you took what was mine." His body flailed and shook with anger. Prof pointed his finger hard at me. "She asked you for a fucking letter, a letter. They sent it to ME, do you fucking remember?!"

I was thoroughly confused. Renee's eyes were wide open at the pair of us. I barely remembered Gala. Girly, thick accented, lost look in her eyes. Prof woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you." She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

I tried to think back, three years ago. Visiting Prof's house at any time was very uneventful. I thought for a moment, "No, I don't th--"

"LIAR!" He screamed at the top of his lungs, "YOU are A FUCKING LIAR! You're an awful fucking person. You remember she ASKED YOU? You came to my house and she ASKED you to take it. She TOLD ME." He started to tense up further, and Renee stepped back.

"I really don't remember, this was three years ago? Did something happen abou-"

"THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT ASSHOLE, You fucking took that letter from ME, from MY ROOM. YOU INVADED MY PRIVACY, YOU FUCK."

"Prof calm down!" Renee yelled, now half concerned half laughing, queerly intent on what looked like the beginning of a fight. A vein or two appeared on Prof's neck and/or forehead or whatever.

"Wait, what was this for? What is this letter?"

"It was her unemployment check." Prof hissed.

I tried really hard to remember what I did, and suddenly manifested in my mind an image of grabbing something from the top of a pile of papers. I remembered the request now from Gala. I remembered I found it odd because she never asked anything of me. The only thing that bound us together was our flakey friends at the time.

"Prof, oh my God I'm sorry, I didn't even think about it, I'm so sorry. But she needed that because she was on welfare, no? Were you even dating her th-"

"You violated my privacy," Prof steamed, very pale. "You dented my blood. I was going to use that letter to confront her. But you fucked that up. You fucking asshole, I will NEVER forgive you. You CROSSED ME." And Prof charged at me, throwing a punch in my stomach. It wasn't hard, but the shock was. I felt violated somehow. Prof walked right through me and didn't look back.

"What the hell Prof?!" Renee shrieked, but Prof kept going. I took a step back and tried to understand if I was hurt. At that moment my temper shot up like Renee's ex, and I bellowed a scream. "You idiot?! You think you got some kind of revenge? Over some kind of stupid plan you- THREE YEARS AGO?! You moron! I apologized and you still hit me!"

But Prof marched on, standing up taller now, shoulders straight. Prof slowly faded, saying nothing.

"Do you feel good now?! You feel you won something? You coward! Come back and fight this stupid fight you idiot! WALDO!" But Prof turned a corner and escaped from us.

Of all the hazardous and unwittingly senseless damnations I was given, this was the most humiliating. The only sound left was my heavy breathing. The tense feeling in my gut loomed.

Renee told me to shut up and whispered, "You know, you deserve that."

A second shock overcame me, "What?!" I shot her a hard look, but it didn't penetrate anything.

"You know why. He's right, he's a better person than you. You're wrong about so many things but you just don't see it. You're not a nice guy, you need to know that." Her words stood in the air, dancing and stomping hard on my head, then crashed a car into it, sending it hurtling off a cliff. In angry awe I mulled these words over in my mouth like a baby's challenge and finally started caring enough to hate her.

"Are you for real?! Is this real life? Do you understand what just fucking happened here?! Do you _understand_?"

"PERFECTLY. EVERYTHING IS _FUCKING_ CLEAR. Look at _me_, I've overcome so much. He's right." And suddenly she marched back to the apartment in what I only assumed was some kind of twisted convinced frustration.

"You think you're a fucking Pariah? You think you're prudent?"

"Prudent?" I paused, "PRUDENT?"

"You think you're a fucking, nice guy? You're an awful person."

"PRUDENT?!" I pronounced slowly in disbelief.

"COME _ON_" She ushered, "COME the fuck _ON_. Let's go _home_."

I didn't move, and she was half a block down until she looked back at me and stopped. We waited and watched eachother for a while. I remember being pissed beyond any pissed I could be. I thought I heard Renee start to cry, but her voice was craking from her attempt at intimidation.

"What the fuck is wrong with you?"

I said nothing. My face I knew was screwed up pretty bad. I closed my eyes and started to breathe in, then out, trying to relax.

"You're all full of shit. You're quiet. You think you're fucking innocent, f-fucking thinking? You think you're better than me or Andrew or Prof or any of them? Even a fucking monk begs for money. You're BROKE and SELFISH and A FUCKING IDIOT."

She was waiting for it. Her feet dug in the ground and waited for a shove or anything. But shaking my fist I gave her the bird in her face and said with a rasp, "You are so amazing at wasting my time. Fuck your dishes. You can glue them together when you pick up their pieces in the parking lot. I hope you die crawling under Andrew."

I was pretty sure everyone who lived in the deserted warehouses heard us. And maybe, as I walked away, her second "Idiot!" and a snowball. But both of those missed badly.

Due to some weird personal superstition I kept the light off when I entered the apartment and sobbed a bit. The pit in my stomach he put there still mentally lingered. I tried to get it out by punching the bathtub, by kicking the walls. But it already evaporated into my nerves and my heart pumped it all over. It was tense and remained until I fell asleep and woke up late the next day late. And it felt worse not because it was given to me. Because it felt like it was handed it back to me.








---------------- Dad call. -------------------

"No this is the worst time right now."

"Why son what happened?"

"Nothing happened. What do you want?"

"You want to talk like that to your Dad?"

"You keep calling me, telling me to come back. I have a life, I'm trying to stay here. I'm trying to make a life for myself."

"It's your mother."

"You're there! You can take care of her. It's tough here. It's so tough here." Om

"I fucking love you!" She cried out. I was pretty sure everyone who lived in the deserted warehouses heard us.


 Jack's apartment lights were off. Andrew must have left for the night, and wondered if he gave Renee a key.


...



"You can pick up the dishes tomorrow morning when they're all in peices in the parking lot." 

...

Turned out to be a short night. The sun was starting to rise up. Someone dropped a rose into the sky and the hues started trickling in.

"Andre"

"You don't get your stuff. You don't get your stupid dishes that you never even used."

"They're not yours!" she yelled out.
