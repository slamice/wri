Ch 14

The walk felt long and maybe even arduous. Arduous. Maybe ten blocks away from my apartment, I hear I check myself for music. Maybe a spare headphone or something hid in my pocket.

Much to my disdain Renee's voice sounded off behind me, "Om!"

I didn't turn around, but made the mistake of stopping suddenly, because she knew it was me. She knew my walk, my demeanor. She watched it leave every day and come back all shrugged out at the end of each.

"Om my god!" she said, "I was looking for you."

"You were headed to Andrew's."

"No, I was headed to you." It had only been a few eeks but she looked thinner. Her face was brighter, but that could have been from makeup she started to wear again. We'd been together for so long. When I used to see her she was usually topless, but ((at that moment)) she felt even more naked. Seeing under the distant street lights and hell, even the moon. ((Dimly lit))

"You're seeing Andrew."

"No," she said calmly, smiling. "I was coming to see you."

"This is why we can't have a conversation."

"Hey, seriously I did. I came to get my dishes."

I paused, trying to think of a rebuttal but coudln't think, so I gave in. She smiled back, and I know it felt fake, but there was a possibility. I desperately wanted to believe in her, that's it. It seemed menial I know. But she was inviting and charming and charasmatic and rotten.

"You came on a Saturday night to get dishes?"

"Yea I don't have a life. You don't have to rub it in."

We walked back together slowly in peace despite the cold. We were easily an inch or a mile away from each other, and every so often we'd glanced to make sure we were both going the same direction. But slowly a shity gravity pulled us closer.

She interrupted it with "How about your visa?" as if continuining from a previous conversation.

The chuckle came deep in my throat, but it was mixed with a two in the morning yawn, "You know I didn't get it."

"Maybe the limo people are hiding it."

"They'll need it with all the shady stuff they're probably doing."

She leaned in to me. "If you got the letter." she whispered, her eyes widening, her smile toothening, "then what?"

"Then I'd shoot myself." I told her blankly. "I'd shoot myself in the head with the letter. It's dangerous."

She laughed even though I doubt she understood.

"You know I'm changing too, if you're thinking that can't happen. I may move back west. It's a big decision." She exagerated a smirk.

"You don't like the city anymore."

"I'm fine with the city. I LOVE the city. The city never liked me." I looked at her, now next to me. A vape in her mouth instantly coming with her sentence. She blew smoke rings into the air above us and we watched them hobble off.

Her hand brushed mine a few times until it snuck in an embrace. I laid it limp until I remembered the cherry scent that lifted my heart when I was right out of university, looking in bars and back alleys for mystery and intrigue. Looking for a sullen humble life that still had gruff. Bust mostly looking for a tribe, and Renee was my door to that and a bunch of other sexy stuff.

We strode towards our apartment in silence. As we crossed the large parking lot though Renee and I noticed Prof was coming back towards us. "Hi Prof, how's it going?" He frowned and waved back, in fact on a mission towards us. ((A jerky jerk.))

A bit drunk and angry, he turned withered, depleted. He decomposed in front of us rapidly like a drying leaf in a vaccuum. "I talked to Gala, do you remember my ex-girlfriend?" he yelled at the top of his lungs, "and three years ago, THREE YEARS AGO, you took what was mine." His body flailed and shook. Prof pointed his finger hard at me. "She asked you for a fucking letter, a letter. They sent it to ME, do you fucking remember?!"

Renee's eyes were wide open at the thoroughly confused pair of us. I barely remembered Gala. Girly, thick accented, lost look in her eyes. Prof woo'ed her by leaving a note for her in an internet cafe, "You make me want to be better one day, I could be so awesome with you." She wasn't thoroughly disgusted and they began dating off and on.

I tried to think back, three years ago. Visiting Prof's house at any time was very uneventful. Prof used to live in a house off campus with a few randoms. Equipped with two floors and a basement, it felt massive. He remembered the kitchen. Fruit flies swam endlessly in circles over the sink, milk jugs in the fridge with just a bit of rotting milk skimming the bottom. One roommate had a neglected pug they were always furious at. Because it shat on their beds whenever it could becasue they rarely walked it.

I thought for a moment, "No, I don't th--"

"LIAR!" He screamed at the top of his lungs, "YOU are A FUCKING LIAR! You're an awful fucking person. You remember she ASKED YOU? You came to my house and she ASKED you to take it. She TOLD ME." He started to tense up, and Renee stepped back.

"I really don't remember, this was three years ago? Did something happen abou-"

"THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT ASSHOLE, You fucking took that letter from ME, from MY ROOM. YOU INVADED MY PRIVACY, YOU FUCK."

"Prof calm down!" Renee yelled, now half concerned half laughing, queerly intent on what looked like the beginning of a fight. A vein or two appeared on Prof's neck and/or forehead or whatever.

"Wait, what was this for? What is this letter?"

"It was her visa so she could stay in the country." Prof hissed.

I tried really hard to remember what I did, and suddenly manifested in my mind an image of grabbing something from the top of a pile of papers. I remembered the request now from Gala. I remembered I found it odd because she never asked anything of me. The only thing that bound us together was our flakey friends at the time.

"Prof, oh my God I'm sorry, I didn't even think about it, I'm so sorry. But she needed that to stay in the country, no? Were you even dating her th-"

"You violated my privacy," Prof steamed, very pale. "You dented my blood. I was going to use that letter to confront her. But you fucked that up. You fucking asshole, I will NEVER forgive you. You CROSSED ME." And Prof charged at me, throwing a punch in my stomach. It wasn't hard, but the shock was. I felt violated somehow. Prof walked right through me and didn't look back.

"What the hell Prof?!" Renee shrieked, but Prof kept going. I took a step back and tried to understand if I was hurt. At that moment my temper shot up like Renee's ex, and I bellowed a scream. "You idiot?! You think you got some kind of revenge? Over some kind of stupid plan you- THREE YEARS AGO?! You moron! I apologized and you still hit me!"

But Prof marched on, standing up taller now, shoulders straight. Prof slowly faded, saying nothing.

"Do you feel good now?! You feel you won something? You coward! Come back and fight this stupid fight like a real man you idiot! ANGUS!"

Renee told me to shut up. Prof turned a corner and escaped from us. Renee whispered, "You know, you deserve that."

A second shock overcame me, "What?!" I shot her a hard look, but it didn't penetrate anything.

"You know why. He's right, he's a better person than you. You're wrong about so many things but you just don't see it. You're not a nice guy, you need to know that." Her words stood in the air, dancing and stomping hard on my head, then crashed a car into it, sending it hurtling off a cliff. In angry awe I mulled these words over in my mouth like a baby's challenge and finally started caring enough to hate her.

"Are you for real?! Is this real life? Do you understand what just fucking happened here?! Do you _understand_?"

"PERFECTLY. EVERYTHING IS _FUCKING_ CLEAR. Look at _me_, I've overcome so much. He's right." And suddenly she marched bakc to the apartment in what I only assumed was some kind of twisted convinced frustration. I stood there in shock.

"You think you're a fucking Pariah? You think you're prudent?"

"Prudent?" I paused, "PRUDENT?"

"You think you're a fucking, nice guy? You're an awful person."

"PRUDENT?!" I pronounced slowly in disbelief.

"COME _ON_" She ushered, "COME the fuck _ON_. Let's go _home_."

I didn't move, and she was half a block down until she looked back at me and stopped. We waited and watched eachother for a while. I remember being pissed beyond any pissed I could be. I thought I heard Renee start to cry, but her voice was craking from her attempt at intimidation.

"What the fuck is wrong with you?"

I said nothing. My face I knew was screwed up pretty bad. I closed my eyes and started to breathe in, then out, trying to relax.

"You're all full of shit. You're quiet. You think you're fucking innocent, fucking thinking? You think you're better than me or Andrew or Prof or any of them? Even a fucking monk begs for money. You're BROKE and SELFISH and A FUCKING IDIOT."

What I mistook for patience was actually weakness. I thought I had none left and yet found it overwhelming. 



...





"I fucking love you!" She cried out. I was pretty sure everyone who lived in the deserted warehouses heard us.


 Jack's apartment lights were off. Andrew must have left for the night, and wondered if he gave Renee a key.


...



"You can pick up the dishes tomorrow morning when they're all in peices in the parking lot." 

...

Turned out to be a short night. The sun was starting to rise up. Someone dropped a rose into the sky and the hues started trickling in.

"You don't get your stuff. You don't get your stupid dishes that you never even used."

"They're not yours!" she yelled out.
