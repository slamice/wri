CHAPTER 2

Renee never went to those parties anymore. There was a time when you'd see her out, my guess was when her and Andrew were having rougher and tougher times with eachother. The times that tapered towards the end were like her emerging past spectre status into a sort of lime light. She didn't exude beauty but she held tightly onto her confidence. Her personality ruled conversations and she had great hair.

Because two year prior I stared out my subway train window. Riding through the unlit New York underground was like dropping yourself in a hole. It was all black beams and creatures under the cover of darkness ((maybe make description fit better to Om's character and personality here, better wording for metaphor)). They were the only thing visible until we miraculously emerged into civilization. If the train stuttered and took longer than a ten minute wait, we'd panic inside. Those with appointments would glance at the time every other moment, we'd fret and there'd be plenty of fidgeting. And then we'd move on, as if the conductor thought it was necessary.

At one point the tracks merged together. I could see another train traveleing through the ether drifting towards me. No one made the effort of spying on the person in the other car lest they be mistakenfor a vouyer creep or perv. But I looked and recognized Andrew and the girl with him as we floated next to eachother for a few seconds. We were both headed to the same party. Her tiny mouth laughing in between sentences of pursed lips. I even saw her teeth that night. She took a quick glance through the glass back at me before the train ripped itself back onto a different further track. I decided to meet them at the party instead of the next station, so I made a slow retreat.

That curl in her lip caught me, and what must have been a shirt she silk screened herself brazened with "Youngtitled" (("Zentitled")). The air of her control over the conversation with Andrew intrigued me. The curl in her post conversation smile, sure the glint in her eye and whatever. I wondered how lucky Andrew was or how determined Renee was to find a taller guy.

In a random flat in east Bushwick laid a party with a ton of leaning. ((Against furniture, walls... That's it.)) The conversations were hefty doses of unreality. We philosophized about eachother, who worked where in the city, really, and what that entailed.

"Non profit radio station manager"

"Animal shelter"

""In between jobs""

"Art studio"

"Have no work plans"

"..."

These weren't answers the answerers appeared to support. Because the words crept out of their mouths slowly. Some leaked like drool embarassingly, others crawled out like spiders once a lip flap was open. Most were unamused by their words, happy to have divulged it and talk about how small their apartment rooms were in attics and kind ((pitying?)) peoples' comfortable couches.

Andrew approached me and while I wondered who he knew, he bemused me over a few philosophies on life he was saving to relay on somebody. His girl came over, introduced herself and her post conversation smile, and we discussed the facts.

"So how long have you lived here?" Renee asked ((with a genuine routine in her voice)).

"It's been six years. I got my diploma and am working now in a public setting."

"You like the states?"

"I feel like I've been here all my life." Was a relaxing revelation. Unlike many it wasn't difficult to have gotten here, especially with a work visa, but nicer to forget the war I hated talking about. You know it well, I'm sure. You recall it was full of brave idiots and cowards. Fear was boredom. I forget it all the time, easier since I wasn't fully in it but my parents felt it on me so they were happy for me to leave.

That lip curl was a three parter, because her smile came together like a jigsaw puzzle as we talked, each piece trying to fit itself in. 

She rolled up her sleeves and I asked "Is that a birthmark on your arm?"

"No it's a bruise."

"How did you get that?"

"I got it through living life. It's a life mark. You get it through experience, not when you're being born."







After she broke up with Andy plus a week or two, we started taking these long walks. Walks across Brooklyn. On them she dumped everything she knew on me. Not her childhood memories and memoir, not exactly. Not her entire life. Carefully curated battles and mysterions that circled her victimhood. She lived off dollar vegetables she bought in chinatown for months, cockroaches crawling on her lips at night in her closet room when she slept, her father never loved her, etc. At the time I thought it bizarre to divulge such secrets, but only later realized they were to be taken as evidence, someone had finally come to save her from it all. It was flattery and pity. 

I didn't want to admit needing her. She was beautiful, was struggling regardless of how, and had been through hard to harder times.






A mutual acquintance of hers, Jacob, worked for a shifty landlord owning a row of warehouses with offices above each of them. The rent was cheap and the walks weren't far from the transit. So together a month or two in to dates her lease was up and she moved in with me. It was quick but, there was a prevailing loneliness in my life. My attic apartment then, looking out on sidewalks where every night shadow creatures invaded and reminded me of the crime per neighborhood ratios. They took my aside and tried to reason with me. I'd lived through worse but the decision was obvious in the moment.

So Jacob helped us out. We were cornered off on the edge of Bushwick. A few blocks away were high rises and cafe's where the rich purged their money. But we didn't want to afford a high rise, couldn't anyway. We ended up living above a limo dispatch breaking multiple zoning laws. Our mail was to be delivered to their office no one the wiser. 

Unfortunately shortly after Jacob ignored saying hello to a harrassing high school gang they took offense and fractured his face with a rock. His entire philosophy of life shifted after doctors put a metal plate in his cheek. He re-examinined his existence and moved to a ranch in the mountains leaving Jack, Prof and eventually Andy the keys to a huge skylighted room littered with sheet metal.

Renee and I walked back to our makeshift apartment when we saw a light was on ahead of us. Since we moved in we hadn't visited Jack and his friends. I hadn't seen him since the dance party. He lived with Andy and Prof. If you're wondering then yes, Prof is not his real name. He had one that was slightly more embarassing but fairly uninteresting.

"We should at least stop by to visit them."

"I mean maybe Jack but that's it. Just _avoid_ Andrew. Why am I supposed to see him?"

"Because he's still my friend-" she said, stammering.

"He used to beat you." I said sharply, "I just don't understand why you'd want anything to do with him."

"Yea but that's old! That was ages ago. I mean he used to get really mad but he's getting in a better place. He's moving to a BETTER PLACE in his life. Can't you see that?"

We walked underneath their window and before another protest Renee yelled up for Andrew. From the second floor Jack's sleepy face poked out, and sleepier voice yelled down "Yeah he's here. Come up!". Jack's girlfriend, a squirrelly girl named Sarah came down to open the door, her hair a bushel and her front teeth just slightly bucked.

I could have walked off but Gala tapped me on my shoulder and reminded me she needed me. She was hungry and cold, shivering in a fraying sweater. So I followed them up holding a blank face in front of my own. The wooden stairs creaked as we carefully up them.

Andy's apartment was a desolate. It was a single huge room he lived in with Jack and Prof. Each of the three bedrooms were quarantined off with shower curtains. The ceiling was low. Anyone taller than 6 feet could only stand upright in the very middle of the apartment under one of two windows, the skylight. It was a bit hard to imagine the place designed for anything but a mess. Littered on the floor were Prof's coffee mugs and cappuccino cups. Jack's paints were next to them with beer bottles, cigarette trays complete with ash, nails and chipped wood. Signs of Andrew were everywhere but his main manifest was a pile of philosophy and spiritual books. The lighting, as with all of the lighting within the industrial area we lived in, was a depressing florescent.

There was barely a kitchen thrown off to the side. A tossed lopsided fridge in a corner. A cutting board sat on the counter with a cleaver sticking straight up out of it. "For cutting cheese," Sarah whispered when she caught me glimpse at it. The inhabitants loafed around unapologetically, eyes a tad hazy.

There was art. Jack's work lined the walls and floor underneath. Lots of paintings. A desert with a naked woman standing by a cactus, a mesh of naked women spewing out of a drain. A pair of boobs floating in the sky. Different chairs were painted various hues, one had a tv glued to its seat with a portrait of a seagull. These things came to Jack casually, painted with pastels and cigarette smoke. I hadn't seen Jack's latest art in a while. 

"Which one do you like?" Jack scratched at his hands, a bit dry and peeling.

"Where do your ideas come from?" I asked.

"Sometimes in my sleep, sometimes they creep up on me. Sometimes they come to me like a locomotive." proud of remembering something he considered archaic to use.

"I like this one", his girlfriend Sarah yawned out a whine. She pointed to a painting with a woman wearing no pants, in fact nothing but a tiny t-shirt that said "NO cooking". She rode a horse into space.

Jack also covered the walls in masses of text and melting heads. Quotes from Burroughs and Ginsberg were scribbled, smeared and softened. Some of the text was attached to torsos and huge brains that looked suspended in midair. It's as if someone sipped some ink and spat on the walls repeatedly. Pollack chewing, drooling tobacco in disgust, rubbing his face in it. "Irregular atmosphere, timid and reluctant" was written in one corner. "Art space for drunks" was written in another.

Behind us Prof's shadow danced loudly against one of the curtains as he rummaged through a box of tools.

These were all horrible distractions that only dug into me more. But an incredible fucking waste of time, Andrew, sat on the floor, rolling a joint on a crate. He licked his fingers and pressed them against the thin paper. His sockets were deep in his face, naturally born that way. He always looked either sad, indifferent or angry. Renee explained previously that he probably always felt like he was missing something and never found it. That something was probably his unborn twin, dead in the womb. He could never forget the memories he never had with his brother. His parents were worried he'd go through the rest of his life with regret. It certainly looked like they were winning their bet.

"So what are you doing these days Andy?" Renee asked him cheerfully.

Andrew rolled the joint between his fingers, responding casually without looking up at her, "I'm working up at Cuppa Joe, also working on the film script with Ethan and Marley. We're sharing some of the dialogue and there's a big funeral scene with a eulogy. That's all I can say really."

He was obviously very uncomfortable. The marijuana smoke trailed up and swirled above his head in a halo. He took a sip and then handed it over to Jack. Sarah turned it down, but watched attentively.

"That's exciting!" Renee said with a huge grin, overemphatically "I'm super happy for you! A movie, it really sounds like you're going places Andy!"

"Jack's in it too actually. He got a part as the protagonist's friends." Jack nodded in agreement. Sarah stared at Jack then off into space.

"Oh really?!" Renee squealed. "I didn't know they'd invite so many people on this, they were pretty secretive about it."

I wondered about what the movie was about. I didn't know much about Ethan and Marley but I met them a few times when they picked Renee up. She knew them through practiced ayahuasca once a month in a forest. They puked the whole night together, calling it purging. Marley painted pictures of flowers and giggled every other word. Ethan was involved in two huge children's productions that made them well off for a while. They both wrote scripts for hollywood that couldn't make it past the noses of producers. But this time it was their movie, probably about something holistic and etherial like Super Yoga.

Jack muttered in, "Yea they had auditions and yeeeeaaaa I can do that." but then he turned his attention to me, "Long time no see, so how's it going?" he patted me on the back, "How've you been?"

"Are you still working at the, what... The software thing? place?" Sarah asked out of nowhere.

"Yea I'm still there."

"Well do you like it?" Sarah feigned interest.

"Yea it's alright, I don't know. I don't really like everything about my work."

"But is it FUN?" Jack looked at me. I was a bit surprised at how serious his tone was suddenly.

"Yea it's ok, I like programming I guess." I tried not to look at Andy. His presence made me uncomfortable, in fact the whole situation did.

"I guess you can make a lot of good money but it's pretty menial work. I talked to Matt, he's not too into it." and then Jack went on and on.

Jack must have felt the weird tension? How often did this situation occur, lovers of the past and present fight it out with passive aggressive blows. Probably fairly often but still. Andy and I hadn't talked in months. Our last conversation, typical of Andy, was how the universe was expanding but could barely accommodate anyone even though the people in it were dying. Andy knew I was Renee's latest best friend supposably. He was sullen, apathetic at first glance, nothing unusual. But I'm sure it *dug* deep into him.

In the corner were a few Kerouac novels Jack was fond of. Next to those were records piled on the ground. Glancing at the titles, they were mostly 80's new wave or early 90's American noise rock. Their jackets were worn and tired. I started to leaf through the records to feel busy.

A pile of brochures and mail were stacked near the records too, and I peeked at them while I thought the others were busy with the nothing they were doing ((did)). Under some final sales and subscriptions was one with Gala's name on it. I folded it and stole it quickly into my back pocket and continued to rummage through Camper Van Beehtoven and The Microphones.

Renee was talking with Andy excitedly again about nothing in particular, in this case her mother.

"- and she's still at that house. Do you remember when you snuck in to wait for me?"

"Yea, I remember her look."

"I never heard this. So what happened, he broke in?" Jack intevened. Then I thought I saw Renee give Andy a potential flirt, maybe not living up to its fullest but it was definitely made available. I sat there questioning its authenticity when she answered.

"He climbed in through the window because he thought I was asleep but I was out then getting cigarettes. So he waited in the bathtub because he was ridiculous, not expecting my Mom to come back that weekend and walk through the door. I think she was at some kind of 'start your business' seminar."

"She didn't like it." Andy's voice crept back in on top of Renee's.

"You were crazy for doing that! You were crazy. She was pretty crazy too. I'm sure I told I used to wait for her for hours after school for her to pick me up. People worried about me then. She was always running errands."

How he could use a new type of herbal medication. How she's woken up sick with a rash on her face down to her arm, bed struck and unable to go work. Prof brooded in the shadows not saying anything, and I could see a silhouette putting on some black blurry headphones.

I didn't understand the meaning and didn't have a good idea of why I was there. What was floating in the atmosphere then? Sarcasm, grief, irony? The art slunked up against the walls undeterred by its inhabitants. I felt I was pretty small here. Even with the art, the flex-rooms, the smoke, dust, dirt and the people, the room still felt so empty. If you winked you weren't sure they were there. Like nothing was sure to exist in this space.

After about twenty minutes of this, I signaled to Renee I was leaving. She waved that she'd catch up with me in a few minutes, but got up anyway. I took a quick last look at Andy. He noticed, got up in fact, and in front of us all he looked me in the eye and said, "I forgive you" smiling, and shook my hand. His sockets were sunk like battleships. I shook back blandly and headed towards the stairs, ignoring the glances.

"You can come back and visit." Jack sleepily waved. The rest of the goodbyes procrastinated until we were out the door.

"Andy's changed! He's got a job and his life is getting stable. He's doing better," Renee was excited, almost blushing.

"Why do you care about someone who beat you?"

"He's a part of my life. You have to accept that. I've known him for so long."

And she tried to bring me back, "Hey! Come on! Don't worry of course I still love you. I'm with _you_ now! Come on!" I made a shut up smile. We walked back slowly in silence to the limo office, the only sound were Renee's inner thighs rubbing against each other wearing down her jeans.

"I'm going to the store for a bit. By the guitar shop."

"Can you get me cigarettes?"

"I'm not buying you cigarettes."

"Why not?"

"Don't you have enough?"

She was defiant "Hey I'm cutting back. Why are you watching me so close anyway? Shouldn't you be worried about yourself? You're just bones Om. How about you eat more?"

I shut the door and tredged off, signalling Gala. To my surprise she agreed to come immediately since she was only minutes from my area. We agreed to meet down a few streets near an alley a few families of crows owned, far enough from the general direction of our friends and enemies.

Who I saw under the light was a different person though. Gala's face lit the the corner and held a tenderness I hadn't noticed before.

"You got the money?" I smiled.

Her horrible imitation of a shady hooligan said "Yea I got your money if you got the stuff" and she laughed. I saw Her teeth you'd see them with every hard laugh, her mouth opening wide like an aligator's so you'd see them all. Perfect pearls.

"You living with anyone right now?"

"Yea I'm bunking with a friend. You know Ming?"

She looked at me waiting for an answer because the implicit no wasn't enough. I made her wait to watch her a bit longer. "How long is this fight with Prof gonna last, or is it quits?"

"I'd rather not talk about that." And her joy crawled back inside herself, but her  blush remained on her cheeks.

"I really hope you enjoy the eighty seven or so dollars in change from the unemployment office." I dared. She looked down the empty street and her shoulders fell. ((Om thinks she's acting but she may not be acting, his interpretation. Lots like this to make more obvious in subtle ways)).

I reached into my jacket and suddenly Gala was a careful watcher. The hand to my jacket, hand to the envelope, to her hand, to my face. She sounded out thank you in a voice so sincere it must have been practiced.

Then she drifted off over the warehouses barely missing the streetlight. She floated above the east river, over the spiked concrete, her angel wings almost catching on a flag pole, back into the sky where she came from. I held my breathe until she was gone from sight, then inhaled the winter back in, marching single-file back to my apartment a new slave.
