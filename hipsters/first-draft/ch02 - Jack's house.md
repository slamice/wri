Ch2. This sets the scene for who his coworkers are, who his gf is, who he is. The cat is a siren. We learn he is tired of his office life, working like a broken machine.




My body fought me and woke up. Ten, twenty or thirty minutes more of sleep didn't seem to matter to it anymore. It humiliated me but I whined back. I didn't want to go to work. I didn't want to work. Was I just bad at it or did I hate my job? I wasn't sure.

There were no curtains on my windows yet, for months, but I somehow slept late into a late morning with the sun pawing at my face. That day I woke up still in a bizarre dream while Renee dozed next to me in a really thick sleep deep in a gutter. The bed springs squirmed, and as I got up slowly, they bit back audibly. I slipped off the bed, grabbing my jeans from the floor and a shirt from the rack. Renee's cat Chibi laid on a pile of our clothes looking up at me, tired and bloated. It watched me wander around the room. With its' eyes it asked me, "why are you awake, that's a pitiful thing to be."

Anything eaten too early in the morning I gagged on. Apples, oranges, toast. The only thing that stayed down were latte's. 

The sun poked me and the morning met my gaze. It glared a mean hello. The day was bright and cheery and yet profoundly and beautifully mundane. The water pressure in the shower was still way too hard. It sprayed me like an elephant in a zoo, the drops pelted in a rage. My button up was too big for me, like someone threw a blanket on a chair and it just sat there. I wore it anyway.

Everyday I shaved and tapped my razor handle against my hand so it would vomit out the hair. I used to tap the sink, but Renee heard it in her dreams. It was far too loud and she hated waking up in the morning to it, tiny hair spraying against the sink so early. "No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a huge razor to the floor.

The room defined askew. The bag of my socks were under random bits of clothes and books. It was pretty late but the only way to find anything was to start cleaning. Around laid trash bags of clothes and boxes unopened, half opened, opened for business, closed, etc and etc. A thin coat of stuff covered the floor and I tip toed over it. Our apartment was above a shifty limousine dispatch, neighboring a recycling office.

After shifting the couch I found a pair of socks. Renee moaned in her sleep softly but the wake of it was loud enough. I still heard it as I shut the door quietly behind me.

I don't need to but will mention the owners' of the place were dodgy themselves. Double dodgy. Two cousins from rich Indian families bought this building and then started the limo dispatch on the first floor a century back. One never came to the office once office. His pictures were all over it though with the latest limousine models. The other, simply nicknamed Raf, was shackled under house arrest for arranging prostitute rides for political clients amonth into our lease. I found that out in a newspaper one day, on the coffee table in my office. The print read Raf talked behind high caliber clients' backs. He called the prime minister 'little dictator' while dispatching a driver and an unclassy broad. Oh and he was our landlord.

We arranged a deal with Raf that we'd pay to live in his illegally zoned apartment for nothing more than rent and to shut up.

Outside, our neighboring recycling station stood tall and busy. People were fast at work, trucks driving in and out recycled whatnots, laughing loudly at each other just because. The bottles, cans, tins, broken glass, milk jugs were sorted, tossed and recombined with each other. I wasn't clear exactly what they did with the recycling besides pack it in clear plastic bags. You could plainly see their wealth of trash. One day it'll be useful, but for now it's just for show.

Past the few warehouses, the territorial crows buzzed around one corner, some above my head. One in particular swooped down on me daily, nearly scathing my hair. So territorial. I ignored it completely though, it really wasn't worth it. The city was already awake and in full motion. Cars went places. The coffee shop lines were long and the trains were packed.

The sea of people ebbed and flowed to the train and I swam with them. I wondered about these strangers, and how strange they were. I wondered for a few moments where she went home, who he wanted to be, who are these people's parents. Where do they think they're going and where are they actually going.

On the train each person tried to sneak a silent look at the other. A cough gurgled up from somewhere buried in the crowd. Off the train, I hobbled up the the station stairs.

"Michael good morning!" Michael just came out of the building and placed himself in a nook. He towered over the street, passing walkers and me.

"Isn't it too early to smoke?"

"Morning Om. It's not too early. -You're - not too early," he smiled.

"Yea well I wasn't really looking forward to today." I said casually, trying to mimic him, "This project never ends Michael."

"You've got to bear with it. We could say we fixed a whole state's license system by the end of this. It's a long haul."

People rushed across the intersection, most in suits and black skirts. The sky cleared a bit and shed some light on the dank dirty sidewalk.

I sputtered out, "But, today's gonna be hectic and quiet. Like a goldfish dying. I don't really see an end to any of this."

"Like a goldfish dying?"

"I don't know, nothing. It's a long story."

"How long?" He coughed out.

"Well, Actually..." I paused. "it's a short or long story depending on how you tell it."

He chuckled a bit. He waved me in a see you later. The slight wet heat mugged me one last time before the air conditioner gushed in my face.

It was sort of a race. I could never wake up early enough to get to work on time. The walls of the office were painted off hue primary colors. Shy bold statements. As I laid on my desk, the usual suspects were already there programming. The lazy hellos and good mornings were drilled out slowly like a list.

 Their clothes were a bit dapper in a casual way. Lucius wore a tight button up with a wrinkled collar. Tyler distinctively cared less about his ratty dress shirt than his rattier combed hair. The only chatter in every department was the computer keyboards whispering their damnedest. Every so often a private phone call came to life in a room buried in a corner somewhere.

I stared a bit at my coworkers but not long enough to not draw attention to myself. People engaged their whole hearts, a bit at a time, monotonously trying to make their work come alive. They pushed pixel after pixel and then a few more, some faster than others. I could see it in their glazed eyes. Everyday we talked over problems. Made micro adjustments. We took ten of them and tore them up all at once. Everyone was terribly excited over these changes. We all thought, these problems existed to be solved. Driver license systems needed to be overhauled, redone. Pictures needed cropping. Reports needed to be created. Claims needed to be claimed. How would we graph it, how could we get more information out of them?

Mik walked in the room, "Well good morning!" it came out like a question, his dutch accent thick and pronounced. I nodded and smiled back at him a good morning. Mik was a product manager committed to creating the most relaxed environment possible. The day proceeded and time was butchered into planning, lunch and typing. Oh, and clicking. We compiled lists of items and descriptions of them. We drew what they could look like out and threw most of them away.

Lunch came and left. Four in the afternoon clocked in and left shortly after. I couldn't tell but felt it, felt how time was lucky like that. Literally leaving any time it wanted.

Midday our business analyst Ryan sifted through photos. "There is no difference," Ryan interrupted no one, "from hipsters and the homeless. It's really really hard to tell the difference." Tom chuckled and relaxed into a smile.

Ryan peered over at me. "Do you know the difference?"

"I think homeless people have more fashion sense I guess?" Tom muttered smiling.

But I intentionally ignored them and zoned out. I zoned out a few times daily. To what I can't remember. To random things. It's kind of the definition as well, designed to forget.

You have to understand. I tried to build things so they could speak to me. The screen should have screamed something intelligible instead of staring back at me, blandly holding up the garbage boxes and text I drew on it. Sometimes deep down I want to just let things be. There are enough natural rules already.

I was in the hallway, between snacks and lack of snacks, when Mik approached me. "Hey Man!" he wore cowboy boots that day, in defiance to the more fashionable of the managers sporting their dusty three peice suits. His glasses were thin but still  made his nose look obtruse like it was poking you and the conversation you had with him. "Haven't talked to you in a while."

"Nothing really to talk about."

"You sure?" He asked, intentionally changing his face to puzzled, not holding back that it was a fake natural look.

"Yea I'm pretty sure." I wasn't sure what I was supposed to feign. Regret, fatigue, accomplishment maybe. He still stood there though, expecting me to excuse as it grew more awkward.

"You'll let me know right? Tell me when you feel comfortable. If it's something or nothing. Did you get your visa?"

"Not yet, no."

"Let me know when you get it. There's details and all that to resolve. We don't you to need us to continue to support you forever." And he actually winked.

"Of course not I wouldn't want th-"

"Unless you wanted to continue to work here." He paused but not long enough for it to be a legitimate, and then laughed at his remark and sidled off as just kidding as he headed to his office, one of the few of us who had an office.

I dug into work almost as seriously as I dug into my chips. It didn't behave and needed wrangling.
