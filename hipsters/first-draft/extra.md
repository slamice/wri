I think I walked the length and breadth of manhattan. Well, at least the nicer parts.

Cowboy rollerskater in central park. 

So late at night, I tried to look back at Manhattan from the bridge. But I was flung on the far rightmost track, and I couldn't see much of anything. Only a few bright windows against a dark black granite backdrop, maybe some water somewhere. I sat for minutes, the train even stopped once. But the bridge's beams blocked and only glimmers of light shined through. We eventually went into a tunnel. New York was too full of itself.

I debated laundry. "Well, you've got to get done." ((Too lame?))

Most people expect alleys to be dark, and most are, but only the most observant or those who live in alleys know that they can be bright fleetingly. In the mornings or afternoons you can look up and see the bright moving clouds. You can watch them longingly and you can sulk while you watch them. And you can wonder what you drank earlier after you notice the tip of your tongue is burnt.


------------------------


You know me enough to know I didn't smoke that night, or any night then. It's not like I was trying to be a saint or anything. It felt like a sad thing to do. I tink it's a depressant, actually. And yea I tried it. I smoked on and off for a few months. Renee did too, Renee did it a lot. We'd go somewhere and we'd literally have to budget for coffee and cigarettes. All the time. And it ate away at my budget. and yellow fingers and teeth and all that cliche stuff. You don't notice it when you do it but when you're watching it you notice it more. But that stuff I only started noticing it recently though. You only get it when you do it for so long anyway.

It was a grand time to be alone.

Tonight was a bizarre switch from the usual rigamarol, a dance party instead of a show instead of はんたい. It was probably _a thing_ I guess.

I made a hard nod at the tapestries girl But she ignored me with a hard ignore.

Woork chapter:

The weather sucked. On what exactly wasn't important. There's a whole hidden season people choose to ignore. Its' heavy with musk and wet and dreary. Routines become slogs and everyone feels it. My energy drained, my ambitions shot then. Often around times that I wondered if there was a tear in me. Usually the pain of it disappeared and I could feel like a normal person. around the is season though it howled, mostly in the mornings. It stung and I'd feel the gash all around me, bleeding into the world.










My body fought me and woke up. Ten, twenty or thirty minutes more of sleep didn't seem to matter to it anymore. It humiliated me but I whined back. I didn't want to go to work. I didn't want to work. Was I just bad at it or did I hate my job? I wasn't sure.

There were no curtains on my windows yet, for months, but I somehow slept late into a late morning with the sun pawing at my face. That day I woke up still in a bizarre dream while Renee dozed next to me in a really thick sleep deep in a gutter. The bed springs squirmed, and as I got up slowly, they bit back audibly. I slipped off the bed, grabbing my jeans from the floor and a shirt from the rack. Renee's cat Chibi laid on a pile of our clothes looking up at me, tired and bloated. It watched me wander around the room. With its' eyes it asked me, "why are you awake, that's a pitiful thing to be."

Anything eaten too early in the morning I gagged on. Apples, oranges, toast. The only thing that stayed down were latte's. 

The sun poked me and the morning met my gaze. It glared a mean hello. The day was bright and cheery and yet profoundly and beautifully mundane. The water pressure in the shower was still way too hard. It sprayed me like an elephant in a zoo, the drops pelted in a rage. My button up was too big for me, like someone threw a blanket on a chair and it just sat there. I wore it anyway.


The room defined askew. The bag of my socks were under random bits of clothes and books. It was pretty late but the only way to find anything was to start cleaning. Around laid trash bags of clothes and boxes unopened, half opened, opened for business, closed, etc and etc. A thin coat of stuff covered the floor and I tip toed over it. Our apartment was above a shifty limousine dispatch, neighboring a recycling office.

After shifting the couch I found a pair of socks. Renee moaned in her sleep softly but the wake of it was loud enough. I still heard it as I shut the door quietly behind me.

I don't need to but will mention the owners' of the place were dodgy themselves. Double dodgy. Two cousins from rich Indian families bought this building and then started the limo dispatch on the first floor a century back. One never came to the office once office. His pictures were all over it though with the latest limousine models. The other, simply nicknamed Raf, was shackled under house arrest for arranging prostitute rides for political clients amonth into our lease. I found that out in a newspaper one day, on the coffee table in my office. The print read Raf talked behind high caliber clients' backs. He called the prime minister 'little dictator' while dispatching a driver and an unclassy broad. Oh and he was our landlord.

We arranged a deal with Raf that we'd pay to live in his illegally zoned apartment for nothing more than rent and to shut up.

Outside, our neighboring recycling station stood tall and busy. People were fast at work, trucks driving in and out recycled whatnots, laughing loudly at each other just because. The bottles, cans, tins, broken glass, milk jugs were sorted, tossed and recombined with each other. I wasn't clear exactly what they did with the recycling besides pack it in clear plastic bags. You could plainly see their wealth of trash. One day it'll be useful, but for now it's just for show.

Past the few warehouses, the territorial crows buzzed around one corner, some above my head. One in particular swooped down on me daily, nearly scathing my hair. So territorial. I ignored it completely though, it really wasn't worth it. The city was already awake and in full motion. Cars went places. The coffee shop lines were long and the trains were packed.

The sea of people ebbed and flowed to the train and I swam with them. I wondered about these strangers, and how strange they were. I wondered for a few moments where she went home, who he wanted to be, who are these people's parents. Where do they think they're going and where are they actually going.

On the train each person tried to sneak a silent look at the other. A cough gurgled up from somewhere buried in the crowd. Off the train, I hobbled up the the station stairs.

"Michael good morning!" Michael just came out of the building and placed himself in a nook. He towered over the street, passing walkers and me. He towered over me. He was the only I could confide in, despite the age gap.

Michael was an olympic gold medalist in a team of 8 in some 15 years prior. This didn't sound like anything to me, a non-title, until someone looked at it differently and said he was the best in the world at something. Michael won and was a winner. He brought in his trophy once, showed us slow motion videos of him making the final strides to the finish line. A perfect combination of brute and strategy. But then it depressed me, how he was now 15 years later coding software. As if that wasn't enough, he had to win at that too. It's still depressing me.

"Isn't it too early to smoke?"

"Morning Om. It's not too early. -You're - not too early," he smiled.

"Yea well I wasn't really looking forward to today." I said casually, trying to mimic him, "This project never ends Michael."

"You've got to bear with it. We could say we fixed a whole state's license system by the end of this. It's a long haul."

People rushed across the intersection, most in suits and black skirts. The sky cleared a bit and shed some light on the dank dirty sidewalk.

I sputtered out, "But, today's gonna be hectic and quiet. Like a goldfish dying. Well, ok, I _optimistically_ don't really see an end to any of this."

"Like a goldfish dying?"

"I don't know, nothing. It's a long story."

"How long?" He coughed out.

"Well, Actually..." I paused. "it's a short or long story depending on how you tell it."

He chuckled a bit. I wasn't sure why ((comment didn't make sense)) but I did too. He waved me in a see you later. The slight wet heat mugged me one last time before the air conditioner gushed in my face.


It was sort of a race. I could never wake up early enough to get to work on time. The walls of the office were painted off hue primary colors. Shy bold statements. As I laid on my desk, the usual suspects were already there programming. The lazy hellos and good mornings were drilled out slowly like a list.

 Their clothes were a bit dapper in a casual way. Lucius wore a tight button up with a wrinkled collar. Tyler distinctively cared less about his ratty dress shirt than his rattier combed hair. The only chatter in every department was the computer keyboards whispering their damnedest. Every so often a private phone call came to life in a room buried in a corner somewhere.

I stared a bit at my coworkers but not long enough to not draw attention to myself. People engaged their whole hearts, a bit at a time, monotonously trying to make their work come alive. They pushed pixel after pixel and then a few more, some faster than others. I could see it in their glazed eyes. Everyday we talked over problems. Made micro adjustments. We took ten of them and tore them up all at once. Everyone was terribly excited over these changes. We all thought, these problems existed to be solved. Driver license systems needed to be overhauled, redone. Pictures needed cropping. Reports needed to be created. Claims needed to be claimed. How would we graph it, how could we get more information out of them?

Mik walked in the room, "Well good morning!" it came out like a question, his dutch accent thick and pronounced. I nodded and smiled back at him a good morning. Mik was a product manager committed to creating the most relaxed environment possible. The day proceeded and time was butchered into planning, lunch and typing. Oh, and clicking. We compiled lists of items and descriptions of them. We drew what they could look like out and threw most of them away.

Lunch came and left. Four in the afternoon clocked in and left shortly after. I couldn't tell but felt it, felt how time was lucky like that. Literally leaving any time it wanted.

Midday our business analyst Ryan sifted through photos. "There is no difference," Ryan interrupted no one, "from hipsters and the homeless. It's really really hard to tell the difference." Tom chuckled and relaxed into a smile.

Ryan peered over at me. "Do you know the difference?"

"I think homeless people have more fashion sense I guess?" Tom muttered smiling.

But I intentionally ignored them and zoned out. I zoned out a few times daily. To what I can't remember. To random things. It's kind of the definition as well, designed to forget.

You have to understand. I tried to build things so they could speak to me. The screen should have screamed something intelligible instead of staring back at me, blandly holding up the garbage boxes and text I drew on it. Sometimes deep down I want to just let things be. There are enough natural rules already.

I was in the hallway, between snacks and lack of snacks, when Mik approached me. "Hey Man!" he wore cowboy boots that day, in defiance to the more fashionable of the managers sporting their dusty three peice suits. His glasses were thin but still  made his nose look obtruse like it was poking you and the conversation you had with him. "Haven't talked to you in a while."

"Nothing really to talk about."

"You sure?" He asked, intentionally changing his face to puzzled, not holding back that it was a fake natural look.

"Yea I'm pretty sure." I wasn't sure what I was supposed to feign. Regret, fatigue, accomplishment maybe. He still stood there though, expecting me to excuse as it grew more awkward.

"You'll let me know right? Tell me when you feel comfortable. If it's something or nothing. Did you get your visa?"

"Not yet, no."

"Let me know when you get it. There's details and all that to resolve. We don't you to need us to continue to support you forever." And he actually winked.

"Of course not I wouldn't want th-"

"Unless you wanted to continue to work here." He paused but not long enough for it to be a legitimate, and then laughed at his remark and sidled off as just kidding as he headed to his office, one of the few of us who had an office.

I dug into work almost as seriously as I dug into my chips. It didn't behave and needed wrangling.









At six or so everyone began shaking their things, feeling a bit uneasy. Someone ruffled their coat onto themselves, and then pretended to realize it was time to go.

I packed my things and left. Out the door, into the street, on the crowded train. Past them, past the burden that beckoned me to come back again tomorrow but giving it a nod.

The recycling shop was closed, thousands of bottles and cans snug, sleeping and snoozing in their clear bags. I shut my apartment door, the cat whined and whined inside. No purring whatsoever. You could the  low siren rising, like what you'd hear in a foreign country before the silence, before the bombing.

If Renee was awake, it was impossible to tell. Her eye lids were practically shut. Sitting in bed, topless, her posture and nudity fit a greek aristocratic she-lump. What played in front of her was the most unimaginable imaginable television. Horror movies with identical endings, relationship finales foreshadowing later romps. The reality Romcoms poured from her computer like an open facet, spilling and staining the room, ruining the wallpaper. Misunderstood nerds loving curly haired attitude women. One dimensional machos winning over dysfunctional girls only alive to mall and bawl. One man obsessed with "mancaves", girls caked with makeup running down their angry sad faces. ((There were a few plots where they only ate together and incested incestually off each other.))

"How was your day, Om? What did you do?" a seedless grape slid into Renee's mouth.

"Things happened that were less than nothing today." I murmured.

"Can you turn on the washing machine again? I forgot to put the clothes in the dryer. Wash them again so they don't get moldy."

"Did you happen to check the mail?" I perked my ears up a bit.

"No, I had to hurry to work today and didn't have time. I didn't feel like waiting for them, seems busy now too." Her eyes were still glued to the screen, the cat yawned for attention.

"I'm trying to be patient I swear..." flipping through my vinyl and wondered which record would numb effectively. Most were hygenicized, trapped in clear plastic. The 70's, 80's, 90's underground flip by. Nothing was jarring enough to procrastinate to. I shed so many tears over those new wave, no wave, ho wave genres and perhaps they dulled me. Good or bad goosebumps with every listen. Finally I settled on something with a really light voice  to some ambient piano, and started up dinner.

The kitchen was only a tiny mess compared to the living room. Dishes weren't piled high enough to call it a disaster.
Renee gave me a juicer from the 70's, incredibly powerful and just as hard to clean. Fruit flies laid back on lawn chairs on it, sunglasses and a bit of smoothie in their tiny glasses. Occassionally they flew up a bit and waggled around looking for another spot. 

I don't remember what I cooked that night, but I do remember it was bland. I didn't let her cook anyway. She burnt curry once and that was her introduction and goodbye to the kitchen. So I made the food and most of the things I made were courtesy of a diet Renee had dedicated herself to; she wasn't allowed anything fermented, with spice, with meat, ground or with dairy. "Sacrifice, I've been doing it my whole life." She said vigilantly and proud. "Everyone has to write their own story Om. I'm writing my own story, you're in it too." By now I was used to these broad statements. They were one of the reasons I loved her, the insistence and necessity she gave her language. The way she used them to feel independent and smart. Salt was completely out of the question and answer, so I took her dietary challenge as an excuse to make something creative. My mouth took it as a challenge to taste plenty of non-flavors.

Outside stood the vacant parking lots and warehouses, limos occasionally drive to and fro. The window made a frame to the distant city and the reddening horizon. The New York sun wasn't at all like in Lebanon. Somehow it felt bigger there, pulsing with blood and vigor as it slid down the sky. Here the smog painted it smudgy, the tips of buildings poking at it.

A heard the Chinese lady selling clothes, yelling in the distance "sock sock underwear tanktop!"

After dinner and before I slept I sighed downstairs, but they said nothing came that day. There was no mail.

---------------


((I really wanted any of it to mean anything. It tried to make any of it bleed, but it was cold. It was a cold cold world and the hope dies on contact when any asshole mumbles for a light. -elaborate-))

"Do you have one?" Renee asked me.

"I don't carry them in my pocket anymore."

"I guess that makes sense, I gave them to you to carry." she said, slightly backhanded with a chuckle.

"Have you tried," I spoke slowly, approaching the jab tenderly, "actually buying something with money you earned?"

She decided not to respond and we continued in silence. We could feel the deep disdain; a huge cavern. You could make some pretty sweet echoes in there.

"What's this supposed to be now?" She asked.

-----------------

"A statue of words."

"A what?"

"... A figure of speech"

-----------------

"It dawned on me."

"What did?"

"The dawn."

-----------------

 I laid it limp until I remembered the cherry scent that lifted my heart when I was right out of university, looking in bars and back alleys for mystery and intrigue. Looking for a sullen humble life that still had gruff. Bust mostly looking for a tribe, and Renee was my door to that and a bunch of other sexy stuff.

 ----------------


 Prof used to live in a house off campus with a few randoms. Equipped with two floors and a basement, it felt massive. He remembered the kitchen. Fruit flies swam endlessly in circles over the sink, milk jugs in the fridge with just a bit of rotting milk skimming the bottom. One roommate had a neglected pug they were always furious at. Because it shat on their beds whenever it could becasue they rarely walked it.

-----------------


(("Hey man can I have one?" Ryan asked.

"You *just* had one." Jack muttered with a cigarette in his mouth.

"So did you..."

"But these are mine? Come on obviously you had a lot."

"But *one* cigarette man. One," Ryan opened his dear deer eyes in the headlights style. His puppy face became more pronounced.

"Ok, but you bummed the last one off me, you owe me two now." And Jack gave Ryan a peace sign. Ryan took it and the cigarette.))


------------------

A gaggle of girls approached us from a distant block. They wore black sneakers and various modern 80's memorobilia to critical acclaim of eachother.

One of them I recognized, a quasi acquantince, Gala. Gala's face was a puzzle of cultures put roughly together to make the pieces fit then smoothed out, like the apple. Perhaps mutt parents living in mutt apartments over the score of two decades until she jumped off their restless ambitions to somewhat settle into a New York City alley. She was all smiles whenever I saw her, comfortable. She held a bike next to her, and I stared at her trying to get her attention. Whether she dilbertly ignored me was not debatable, so I called her on it.

"Gala!"

"Oh, Om?" Her mass of wavy hair shook back and standing on guard getting ready to be open for a small conversation. Gala's girls suddenly went quiet, wondering why I interrupted. Jack and Ryan walked themselves over. 

"Hey..." Jack smiled, "it's been a while."

"Hey, how are you guys? I've been good."

"Yea, Gala... May I be so bold to say you look like you're doing well." and he nodded in appreciation to his compliment.



The other girls stepped back and talked amongst themselves, slightly bored and antsy.

"Do you see Prof anymore?"

"Not really but we talk sometimes, off and on. You came up recently."

I puzzled, "Why?"

"It was when I was broke and I asked you to pick up something from his place."

"I don't but "

---

Someone tried to call me, my brother. I didn't feel like dealing with it. It wasn't a time to deal with it. But it had to be dealt with. Somehow. I took a few steps away from Jack and Ryan sloppiy shcmoozing Gaby and walked to a lean on the wall. I didn't dread what he was going to say, just if I was going to hear it or mishear it. Or if I was prepared to listen. Tons of little fears like that ate away at me, staring at me phone, at the people, at the distant traffic lights a few miles down the road. 

"Hey how's it going?" My brother asked.

"Yea?" I answered.

"Listen I don't know if you're busy."

"I'm not too busy, may be busy in a bit. Why what's up?"

"Did you find anything out about your visa?"

I sighed hard into the phone. I had little patience for it as it was, let a lone my brother bringing this up, and my Dad, and anyone else who cared enough to rub it in my face.

"You will know when I get it. I'll sneak into the chrysler building and go to the top with and hold the top spike thing with one hand and shake it at the world."

"Chrysler building? What's that anyway?"

"I'm guessing it would be the least guarded one. Anyway, nevermind. I don't have it."

"It's kind of important if you want to come back."

"Is there a point to this?"

She would complain sometimes of chest pain,

"Heart problems maybe." I smiled at her, "but let's be honest, who doesn't have problems with their heart.

The novel is about the loneliness we create for ourselves and what we aspire to do in our lives. A man us stuck between a world he thinks he wants and responsibility.

We will make matsutake gohan to try them first. If the texture is good enough.
