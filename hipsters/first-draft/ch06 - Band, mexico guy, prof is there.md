Despite all the vapers outside, smoke still lingered and began settling. The hazy room held leather and jean jackets of all characters and shapes. I pushed a bit through expecting to find Selina or someone I knew, but it was a loss with this crowd and I was sure she wasn't there yet. I decided to just take to watching the stage silently as the band on it bled its electronic heart out.

There were only two on stage. The lackluster crowd blew bubbles and shuffled in place silently. The band member in the back wore aviator shades a la seventies. Familiar dry techno hums suddenly sounded, and as they dribbled into the room like repeated fingers wrapping on a table. The other, a messy blonde hair picked up the mike and dug it in behind his mop. He staggered a bit, having drunken a few.

They droned on and the set slowed. Every beat was maticulously calously calculated, every song featured the singer closing his eyes tight in a forced bliss. We watched on until it ended and we couldn't and most filed to the bar.

As the crowd slowly dispersed I depressed against the front of the stage. The blonde singer appeared, bearing a beer in hand. Somehow his eye caught mine and we drifted toward each other. The background mug clinks and chats drowned out most of our words. They weren't needed though. Because between sips, his breathe and half drunken elequence he made all his points.

"Interesting set."

"You're welcome."

"I actually didn't like the song about Mexico City. Though."

I could barely hear him when he yelled "Why?!".

And I said I just didn't like it. Provoking. Of course no one was allowed to say it but I gave it a shot. I didn't care about him not caring how much his voice syntha-sucked.

"No no no. You don't understand man. You don't understand. It was Brazilian minimal techno, a mix of Brian Eno's best dance stuff he was doing in the late 90's. Hip hop, you know Mexican hip-hop? You'll have to listen to it again I don't believe you you just don't understand it..."

I said "Yea, maybe I don't understand it."

"No it's ok you have to realize this is great."

There was a weird silence between us while the room crunched papers of conversation.

"You liked the other stuff right?"

"Maybe." I said.

And like that soon we faded awkwardly into a crowd of awkwards.

I noticed Gaby, Prof's ex was in the crowd.

"Hi Gaby" I said. Her tan skin complemented her polka dotted apron skirt. The grey white collared shirt accented the two ear piercings per ear. The contract of white socks with black shoes flattered her. Her spanish short hair was in a bob, and long eye lashes held tightly to her real ones.

"Hey, it's been a while, yea?"

"Yea no kidding it has. What's going on?"

"Nothing much. "

I thought about topics, any really because we shared almost none. Then I remembered "Hey I heard Ernst Hirsch stayed at your place! That's crazy."

"Yea isn't that? Who told you that?" she said it with a huge smiling smug mug.

"Hmm, Prof actually. What's he like?"

"He's unreal, honestly. I mean now he's pretty old, like sixty or so, but he still has a thick German accent. He smoked up a lot when we were there. I don't have a car either so I had to pay for his taxis, since he was getting older he couldnt walk much anywhere."

"That's what I would have expected though, but that's awesome."

Prof came up inevitably. "You see Prof a lot?" Gaby asked. 

"Honestly not really recently. He's working a lot and we don't really have much in common anymore."

What's he up to. Yes they talk occassionally. Not that much but recently they started talking again.
