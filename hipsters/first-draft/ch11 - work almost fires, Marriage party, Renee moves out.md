Ch11. Wedding + Prof fight

----------

Mik's office, cubed off with designer clout and magic, was a proud achievement of corporate culture. I stood in that office that morning, an obstruction.

We chatted briefly, the morning brightened our conversation and along with it came coffees and teas and toast and jam and kids laughing and subtle nuances it was all going down a long disgusting drain.

He started advising me suddenly, and quickly all his jokes vanished, scurrying scared into all corners of the room. His skin somehow paled further, an incredible feat for a native Belgian. His eyes grew sunken in and hollowed out. The plain stare told me "You need to love what you do."

"I know I can do this."

"The longer you take to figure it out the more time you are wasting." staring at me dead on, I was too caught up and barely noticed his shoulder shrug.

(((Make shrugging have a more prominent yet still subtle meaning, giving up on someone == shrugging)))

"How about we give it a month?"

I looked back at him and again he smiled, "a month, right?"

Walking back to my desk, I smiled back and my chest heaved a sigh. All the jeans and lattes the world chugged out were thrown to the floor. I saw pathetic coffee cups and free snacks wading down a stream. They were tasteless and garbage. I hope no one noticed and I shuffled embarrassed to my seat, slightly nasious.

My anxieties played and the words and symbols danced the rest of the day around my screen in front of a picture of a mountain top I only just noticed. (((couldn't see the desktop picture)))

I went to the bathroom. Post lunch, the mirrror wasn't clear, bits of dust and floss aftermath speckled it. A headache was stirring up from the back of my mind. It began reeling, slowly, until it nestled snug right behind my immediate thoughts.

I waved at the faucet to spray out a tiny cold shower of water. It hit my hand but felt at first numb, then very cold. Each drop threw itself dying on my hand, rolling dead down the drain. I wiped my face and kept my hands there. What was wrong with me?

It was a slow slog and schlog. I don't remember much that day,

I thought I'd dillute my shock with Michael, but that's not what happened.

A coffee excuse could work, but when I approached his desk he was hunched over it, in such a deep forboding mood. His fingers heavily smashed down on each key to a black and white screen messed with text. It was a clear sign of frustration to remove all the syntactical sugar, the rainbow of colors that highlighted special parts of the code to aid in development. He stripped down his workplace completely to barely anything to make it run faster. I then noticed, besides his jacket, he threw all his notes out in desperation.

I was seconds away before tapping him on either shoulder but, in a rage, he erected himself furiously to the ceiling and tore the laptop from its cords. He slammed it on the desk again and again, spitting out fuckword after fuckword. A few peices of the machine and his curses flew out to the floor, and neighboring cubicle-ers stared at him in confusion. He walked out miserable right by me to the exit. His laptop lay in a mildly unpleasant electronic heap, a box with a broken frame.

I thought briefly about following him with the crowd but no one else did. The entire office looked at eachother, mulling over the scene again. Slowly the sounds of typing started up, and they forgot.

...


"I'm resigning obviously." Michael said, his hand trembling made it difficult to hold his cigarette.





















Surround ourselves with stuff and ourselves, our own egos, until we can't see nature or anything else beautiful. We build our stuff higher.

For business part, we try to build sky scrapers up to the sky to see nature again, but we only see the grey and brown buildings we built, and all the other people trying to get higher too.

Michael is a by product of this atmosphere. He's striving but hates it, and hides his hate behind sarcasm.

(( Make mIchael talk more about his ambitions but frustrations with corporate life throughout the story. ))

Poorer people ride the trains, travelling underground, underfoot from teh capitalists. Real rich people don't get on the subway. They stay high up watching. They encounter the poor and common man on the streets, ignoring them and barely acknowledging them beyond an obstruction, thinking they are an inconvenience.


Does Om want to be one of these people, to raise his kids and have them grow up and hope they don't snub their noses.

Another concert.

The show was buried in an art collective.

Marriages usually didn't happen, they leave little or at least a bit less room to be flakey.

The autumn weather ruffled us as I walked there with her. The serenity of the situation was dying down but still trying to grope me in all the wrong places.

The lady bug skirt Renee wore bunched at her knees. ((make her sound gross here))

The modern couple bore exact resemblance to each other holistically. They met on a boat to Govener's island eight years ago. Their dreams together were spent in cafes, camping, back in her French hometown. She accentuated every mutilated word and he drank them all in, a bit dripping down his beard. I knew everyone going, not by name and barely by face.

We arrived almost too late at the park and positioned ourselves behind the Parisian mother. Her brooch slowly ate at her shirt black jacket, but she didn't notice because her nose was pulled so high up to the sky by a fish hook. She shook, smiling and distraught at her daughter. A single bead of sweat dared not come down her wrinkled forehead.

The ceremony lasted roughly ten minutes. The priest put down his beer and settled on the podium, leaning against a stand for bocce players to keep their score. It was far enough to ignore their game.

The sermon raged socio-political arguments at the church. A few 'likes' and 'hmm's were thrown in for good measure, all the while the couple smiled into each other's faces. Beaming a few beams at their immigrant parents. Some of their friends hung their heads low and their backs were turned out on invisible hooks.

Rice was tossed along with a few slinkies. They headed towards a picnic table full of strawberries, cake and salmon.

Suddenly a traveling quartet arrived. No one claimed them for the wedding. They trailed up to us slowly. Someone laughed earnestly that this was the bride's French gypsy roots bringing some home with solemn symbols crashing and dancing. The oompa loompa band danced forward and stopped in front of the couple. No one was speechless and we talked over their looks.





The oompa-loomps band jawed and jeered thick horn drawls and hard drum beats at us. We watched wide eyed, smiling and puzzled. The finale was a ten second free jazz sax solo, and they held it out with their hands on their knees with wide eyes, almost in tears.

Their ring leader, Thin man Dan walked out in front of us. He was a tall pencil head who played a tenor sax like a gift teasing us. The band quieted their harmonies until it was only him playing. He did a jig soloing to the air, and all at once stopped suddenly. We all clapped profusely at his talent and beret.

"Friends!" He raised his arms. "We don't know you but applaud this hefty wager you're playing with life. We're all with you, but we're gambling just by throwing in our hats," he tipped his dusty top hat off. It landed with a tiny crunch on the grass. Dan paused. A few people glanced at the hat then back at him. "Shakespeare once said in a mixed review play" he bellowed "'All the world is a stage! You get hitched and life's a bitch!' So please let us be your audience and see through it that you have a happy ending."

He finally lowered his hands and presented them to the couple, "Congratulations!"

Everyone bellowed a few hurrahs and shook hands. The rich parents fluttered about with food and berries as the younger crowd lazily sullied up to the food tables. The fare was fairly better than the usual fodder, cellophane unwrapped delicately. Some drinks were poured and everyone's brains started to get lubed up in the middle of the afternoon.

It turned out Renee knew many people here for years. Marty was an ex-boyfriend and former singer of a sell out band now heading North to work in a hemp factory he's a nice guy you'd like him for sure. Another friend she fell out of touch with because of a cold war relationship in their English class in University.

"Evangeline!" Renee exclaimed.







Conversations built on solid partial memories and strong Hey!s became brittle. Feeling like a trophy hanging limply from a hand, I idled away around the park and sulked against a tree. In a nearby shop I almost bought a cookbook, but I could be moving soon so I didn't. My forehead shined and glazed in the bit of sun that made it through that cloudy day.

Another game of boce started up, and the old Italians measured the balls carefully. In the near distance blurred distance tight jeans intermingled with clad steampunk dresses. Renee very slowly walked over to me, and I looked up at her.

"What's up?" Renee stood over me.

I sat silent, still looking at her face, but mostly her hair.

She sequined her words into a fashionable sing song "When are we getting married, Om?"

We both knew the answer but were completely ignorant about it.((?))
