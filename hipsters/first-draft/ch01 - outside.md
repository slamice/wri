Something in the air was broken. It felt banal and burnt to an odorless cinder. I smelt it still somehow, felt it and watched it with my eyes, deadpan. I looked out across the silent empty street. I thought I saw something move, but only thought.

Cars swept by hissing cats. The area was thick with unrestricted access. The venue itself was tucked above two garages. The owners soldered on a roof with a roof, threw old wood in they were too lazy to dump and charged triple the apartment's worth a month. The door got stuck often but there was a skylight so you knew you could always leave. The space itself was huge, boxed and sanded down with sooted corners. The renters hung a sign outside:

"Guitar lessons? Dance space rental? Warm bodies? Call us."

You've never been there. It was pretty obvious 'The Woods' wasn't going to last much longer than eight or so months. Three thousands of dollars of rent every 30 days was high budgeted even for the 6 renters, especially when the only real job any of them held was barely. At the end of each month they worried, sweatily fumbling. Keeping themselves in check and sober was key, but no amount of coffee or cigarettes could hold back the day the rent was due.

So then there were parties. And then there was us. Shoved up against the outside brick wall as if hung on it, the three of us watched couples and triples go inside. We were determined to be a desperate plea for attention and as nonchalant about it as possible. It was 10 o'clock, waiting for the show to start, probably soon. I tried to keep eye contact with every person who walked in, until they noticed me and I looked away.

"You think Matt'll come?" Jack asked.

"Which Matt, what are you talking about?" Ryan said, half laughing.

"The guy, Matt, in the band."

"Band guy? Yea he's coming." I said.

I decided on my black ((skinny)) jeans that night. The kind your knees get cold in but you don't notice after a while. Made sure the (('dark', because he's telling it)) black jacket was up to par. It was pretty cold with all that. My body shifter in discomfort, I kept fidgeting past my usual number of fidgets. Looking, feeling dumb and horny.


For all it was worth I was pretty calm then. The last few years were longer than I imagined. Longer than my childhood even. I swear. It's a big claim, I know.

You know me enough to know I didn't smoke that night, or any night then. It's not like I was trying to be a saint or anything. It felt like a sad thing to do. I tink it's a depressant, actually. And yea I tried it. I smoked on and off for a few months. Renee did too, Renee did it a lot. We'd go somewhere and we'd literaly have to budget for coffee and cigarettes. All the time. And it ate away at my budget. and yellow fingers and teeth and all that cliche stuff. You don't notice it when you do it but when you're watching it you notice it more. But that stuff I only started noticing it recently though. You only get it when you do it for so long anyway.

Jack and Ryan were tacked on friends. I met them both in university. Ryan was a straight A+ student until college grabbed him by the collar and shoved him into a lazy comma. He remained high on marijuana for eternity. As for Jack, various college degrees tried to swoop down on him, but he was great at avoiding them. Eventually he gravitated towards a bachelors in philosophy and did nothing with it. He sported shoulder length hair, was often seen chittering occasionally wore no shoes. Jack reigned in his own world of canvases featuring surreal modern nude art. He was a pole in every way, quite a lanky questionable sort.

Jack pulled out his lighter for the 3rd time and lit a cigarette. I looked blankly at both of them.

"Hey man can I have one?" Ryan asked.

"You *just* had one." Jack muttered with a cigarette in his mouth.

"So did you..."

"But these are mine? Come on obviously you had a lot."

"But *one* cigarette man. One," Ryan opened his dear deer eyes in the headlights style. His puppy face became more pronounced.

"Ok, but you bummed the last one off me, you owe me two now." And Jack gave Ryan a peace sign. Ryan took it and the cigarette.

My next guess is Matt never shows up. He was usually late and occasionally we'd get pissed at him but we were usually late too. High expectations abound, no one was happy. At least we had cigarettes I don't smoke.

We stood around, scratchy and unnerved. We looked like a shitty polaroid. I started to drift from Jack and Ryan there. These two were innocent compared to the hidden gems inside. I invited them out but honestly I didn't know who depressed me more.

A gaggle of girls approached us from a distant block. They wore black sneakers and various modern 80's memorobilia to critical acclaim of eachother.

One of them I recognized, a quasi acquantince, Gala. Gala's face was a puzzle of cultures put roughly together to make the pieces fit then smoothed out, like the apple. Perhaps mutt parents living in mutt apartments over the score of two decades until she jumped off their restless ambitions to somewhat settle into a New York City alley. She was all smiles whenever I saw her, comfortable. She held a bike next to her, and I stared at her trying to get her attention. Whether she dilbertly ignored me was not debatable, so I called her on it.

"Gala!"

"Oh, Om?" Her mass of wavy hair shook back and standing on guard getting ready to be open for a small conversation. Gala's girls suddenly went quiet, wondering why I interrupted. Jack and Ryan walked themselves over. 

"Hey..." Jack smiled, "it's been a while."

"Hey, how are you guys? I've been good."

"Yea, Gala... May I be so bold to say you look like you're doing well." and he nodded in appreciation to his compliment.



The other girls stepped back and talked amongst themselves, slightly bored and antsy.

"Do you see Prof anymore?"

"Not really but we talk sometimes, off and on. You came up recently."

I puzzled, "Why?"

"It was when I was broke and I asked you to pick up something from his place."

"I don't but "

Someone tried to call me, my brother. I didn't feel like dealing with it. It wasn't a time to deal with it. But it had to be dealt with. Somehow. I took a few steps away from Jack and Ryan sloppiy shcmoozing Gaby and walked to a lean on the wall. I didn't dread what he was going to say, just if I was going to hear it or mishear it. Or if I was prepared to listen. Tons of little fears like that ate away at me, staring at me phone, at the people, at the distant traffic lights a few miles down the road. 

"Hey how's it going?" My brother asked.

"Yea?" I answered.

"Listen I don't know if you're busy."

"I'm not too busy, may be busy in a bit. Why what's up?"

"Did you find anything out about your visa?"

I sighed hard into the phone. I had little patience for it as it was, let a lone my brother bringing this up, and my Dad, and anyone else who cared enough to rub it in my face.

"You will know when I get it. I'll sneak into the chrysler building and go to the top with and hold the top spike thing with one hand and shake it at the world."

"Chrysler building? What's that anyway?"

"I'm guessing it would be the least guarded one. Anyway, nevermind. I don't have it."

"It's kind of important if you want to come back."

"Is there a point to this?"

We were there for another 20 minutes. They went in for a bit to check it out, but I could tell the two of them were getting finicky. Jack finished his cigarette in a few minutes and, "but seriously man I'm gonna bail. I'm really sorry, but I've got this thing with Sarah tonight and it's like you know me I'm sorry." His sentence bowed, shuffled and shrugged.

"It's not a big deal, you don't have to apologize. I'll see you later though, like another night."

"Really sorry I can't right now."  And he slowly walked off waving, with Ryan bumbling and lagging behind him whispering a "me too." Matt never showed up either.





I revisited it because of Gala.
