Something in the air was broken. It felt banal and burnt to an odorless cinder. I smelt it still somehow, felt it and watched it with my eyes, deadpan. I looked out across the silent empty street. I thought I saw something move, but only thought.

Cars swept by hissing cats. The area was thick with unrestricted access. The venue itself was tucked above two garages. The owners soldered on a roof with a roof, threw old wood in they were too lazy to dump and charged triple the apartment's worth a month. The door got stuck often but there was a skylight so you knew you could always leave. The space itself was huge, boxed and sanded down with sooted corners. The renters hung a sign outside:

"Guitar lessons? Dance space rental? Warm bodies? Call us."

You've never been there. It was pretty obvious 'The Woods' wasn't going to last much longer than eight or so months. Three thousands of dollars of rent every 30 days was high budgeted even for the 6 renters, especially when the only real job any of them held was barely. At the end of each month they worried, sweatily fumbling. Keeping themselves in check and sober was key, but no amount of coffee or cigarettes could hold back the day the rent was due.

So then there were parties. And then there was us. Shoved up against the outside brick wall as if hung on it, the three of us watched couples and triples go inside. We were determined to be a desperate plea for attention and as nonchalant about it as possible. It was 10 o'clock, waiting for the show to start, probably soon. I tried to keep eye contact with every person who walked in, until they noticed me and I looked away.

"You think Matt'll come?" Jack asked.

"Which Matt, what are you talking about?" Ryan said, half laughing.

"The guy, Matt, in the band."

"Band guy? Yea he's coming." I said.

Jack pulled out his lighter for the 3rd time and lit a cigarette. I looked blankly at both of them.

"Hey man can I have one?" Ryan asked.

"You *just* had one." Jack muttered with a cigarette in his mouth.

"So did you..."

"But these are mine? Come on obviously you had a lot."

"But *one* cigarette man. One," Ryan opened his dear deer eyes in the headlights style. His puppy face became more pronounced.

"Ok, but you bummed the last one off me, you owe me two now." And Jack gave Ryan a peace sign. Ryan took it and the cigarette.

My next guess is Matt never shows up. He was usually late and occasionally we'd get pissed at him but we were usually late too. High expectations abound, no one was happy. At least we had cigarettes I don't smoke.

We stood around, scratchy and unnerved. We looked like a shitty polaroid. I started to drift from Jack and Ryan there. These two were innocent compared to the hidden gems inside. I invited them out but honestly I didn't know who depressed me more.

Jack and Ryan were tacked on friends. I met them both in university. Ryan was a straight A+ student until college grabbed him by the collar and shoved him into a lazy comma. He remained high on marijuana for eternity. As for Jack, various college degrees tried to swoop down on him, but he was great at avoiding them. Eventually he gravitated towards a bachelors in philosophy and did nothing with it. He sported shoulder length hair, was often seen chittering occasionally wore no shoes. Jack reigned in his own world of canvases featuring surreal modern nude art.

A gaggle of girls approached us from a distant block. They wore pumps and various modern memorobilia to critical acclaim of eachother.

We were there for another 20 minutes. They went in for a bit to check it out, but I could tell the two of them were getting finicky. Jack finished his cigarette in a few minutes and, "but seriously man I'm gonna bail. I'm really sorry, but I've got this thing with Sarah tonight and it's like you know me I'm sorry." His sentence bowed, shuffled and shrugged.

"It's not a big deal, you don't have to apologize. I'll see you later though, like another night."

"Really sorry I can't right now."  And he slowly walked off waving, with Ryan bumbling and lagging behind him whispering a "me too." Matt never showed up either.
