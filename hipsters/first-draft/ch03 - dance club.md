It was a grand time to be alone.

How a show usually played out is posters went up in skate shops, coffee shops, really expensive barbershops. Each of these shops had only 3 items on their menus, those sort of places. Doors at 8, starts at 9. People know it really starts at 10. Bands keep waiting for their drinks and drunks. They go on at 11 or 11:30. It ends at 4am after the fourth band, but the police break it up at 3am. If the show ended earlier (at least by midnight) then fools would dance. Tonight was a bizarre switch from the usual rigamarol, a dance party instead of a show instead of はんたい. It was probably _a thing_ I guess.

And since it wasn't that kind of show though, we didn't technically really have to wait for anyone. It was 90's Dance night and that's a guaranteed win. Everyone there was an angry teenager ((then, ~in the 90's~)) wanting to dye some highlights into their memories. Then we were back in the future. But instead we had 60's pop remakes we forgot about on the radio. Mix that with rap and they're in vogue again. It was one night only until the next 90's dance party five months from then.

By now people stupided towards the door, a few already drinking, a few more warming up with headbands. Some beards were abound, a few lit up.

I flew in profusely like an uncaged canary. Past suit vests. Shirts with "savior" and "moron" emboldened in front of crowds. Some bumped into me accidentally and intentionally. A few jeered at nothing then laughed.

The party was a pagan dance. 90's theme be damned. Someone threw up the 60's, 70's, 90's (but mostly the eighties) onto some far and not finely aged wasted teenage bodies. Everyone was clad with chababyness. The dance floor was surrounded with quotation marks. Fashion was ripe with faux-paus chic and undeniable clashing that somehow made the word "tacky" look tame. Two were dancing the robot like humans. Straight out of Wonderland were Alices in all colors of the rainbow. A ghostbuster did a violent shuffle near a spinster, backpack jigging and all.

Many weirds and beards shot each other, the digital polaroids barely drying between takes. Mouths were open, strung out on jargon, cheap beer and dance music. Some girls made a few soft-core poses, each holding a meaningless subliminal message.

I scanned through the crowds casually. The lights were dim and confused, spraying in every other direction. I recognized a few passing faces in passing.  A few more prominent and active members ignored me. I made a hard nod at one girl made tapestries. Finally Selina waded into the crowd. I caught fleeting glimpses of Selina's roommate Adrian and her periodic boyfriend. They were lost in a few ways, most prominently in dancing.
