CHAPTER 4

Every other day I woke up late and shaved, tapping my razor handle against my hand so it would vomit out hair. I used to tap the sink, but Renee heard it in her dreams. It was far too loud and she hated waking up in the morning to it. "Fucking tap tap tap. No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a huge razor to the floor.

Renee was still asleep when I headed out, her hours sat much later in the day than mine. She worked at an indian medicinal clinic deep in a corner of Greenpoint. In between smoke breaks and relabeling medicine she'd call or text me about dinner or a movie or gossip.




We were cornered off in a neat little corner in the city. A few blocks away were high rises and cafe's where the rich purged. But we didn't want to afford a high rise, couldn't anyway, so Renee found a friend of a friend who worked for someone who had an empty office. We ended up living above a limo dispatch breaking multiple zoning laws. Our mail was to be delivered to their office no one the wiser. 

The receptionist, also a limo dispatcher, was there. Behind that counter was a huge grin, a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She now hobbled busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone 3000km away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight. She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" laughing hard.

Another week, no mail. The government shrugged and said nothing. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me.







There were so many people heading to work ((still)) they blocked the light out completely until I got out. The army of commuters dispersed and I followed my usual route to our 43rd street office and found a hulking Michael out front with a stub between his fingers.

He was an interesting case. At six foot seven he was bound to represent something, which he did. The man spent his life chasing a medal, and he came out a world champion javelin thrower. After winning the gold he rejoiced. But four years later the world was looking for the next world champion javelin thrower, so he decided to move on to a different challenge behind a desk punching keys. ((maybe a boxer?))

He also decided to take up the challenge of smoking which he practiced twice a day.

"Hey Om."

"There's a gym cruise." I told him.

"What does that mean."

"A buy in. It means free food and a ride around Liberty island for whoever wants to hear lectures on how great it'll be to pay hundreds of dollars a month to a gym you won't go to."

Michael itched his beard, "I think I've got to take care of my sister's kid that night."

"A free cruise. It's a free something. Think about it. I don't want to go alone." 

"I'll go then."

The clock ate away at us diligently as we ran around trying to ignore it.



























On the platform was a performer dressed in a full suit playing drums. He sang reggae as he played. I didn't know him but that man had troubles and all that I'm sure. Otherwise he wouldn't play Jamaican music in the subway. But watching him closely, his eyes were loose and unsettled staring every which way, I was unsure how he could play calming music. ((I wondered if he was climbing out of his hole or further in it.)) A friend of mine form university learned how to play the marimba in Zimbabwe. I asked her what thier songs were about since the high notes sounded so chipper. But they were all depressing songs, abuot mourning and death. Maybe this Jamacican man was winging it.
