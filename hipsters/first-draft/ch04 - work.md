CHAPTER 4

Every other day I woke up late and shaved, tapping my razor handle against my hand to vomit out hair. I used to tap the sink, but Renee heard it in her dreams. It was far too loud and she hated waking up in the morning to it. "Fucking tap tap tap. No one does that, it's incessant and tiring." she yawned at me, then mimed an exaggerated throw down of a huge razor to the floor.

She was still asleep when I headed out, her hours sat much later in the day than mine. She worked at an aryuvedic clinic deep in a corner of Greenpoint. When Renee was late or had mono once a week and they accomodated for it. In between smoke breaks and relabeling medicine she'd call or text me about dinner or a movie or gossip. I volunteered briefly out of curiousity but the personalities there were too strong for me. I decided to listen to Renee's tales of the doctors and the far more bizarre patients at a distance. One of the benefits were the first few bottles and boxes of newly imported medicine. She brought home elixirs and herbs promising to revitalize the liver, iron to lighten eyes, tumeric to hydrate you for weeks or mud to clean your digestion. I tried them all and used some of them as spices occassionally.

Before work I crept down there to the receptionist. She bore a velodrome of overweight and an amputated leg. They cut it off years ago after a pretty cool accident. She's hobble busily on her new metal calf sending drivers all across the city. During one crisis, she dispatched someone 3000 miles away. It stuck in her pride from then on, adding more weight, and then a huge grin that dangerously firted with tipping her over.

She gave me the mail in a heap. "Read 'em and weep!" she laughed hard.

Another week and no visa. The government shrugged and said nothing. They weren't thinking of me, they didn't miss me.







There were so many people heading to work ((still)) they blocked the light out completely until I got out. The army of commuters dispersed and I followed my usual route to our 43rd street office and found a hulking Michael out front with a stub between his fingers.




He was an interesting case. At six foot five he was bound to represent something, which he did. The man spent his life chasing a medal, and he came out a world champion javelin thrower. After winning the gold he rejoiced. But four years later the world was looking for the next world champion javelin thrower, so he decided to move on to a different challenge behind a desk punching keys. ((maybe a boxer?))

He also decided to take up the challenge of smoking which he practiced twice a day.

"Hey Om."

"There's a gym cruise." I told him.

"What does that mean."

"A buy in. It means free food and a ride around Liberty island for whoever wants to hear lectures on how great it'll be to pay hundreds of dollars a month to a gym they won't go to."

Michael itched his beard, "I think I've got to take care of my kid that night."

"You have to take care of your kids every night. It's a free cruise, a free something. Think about it. I don't want to go alone." 

"You're not taking your girl?"

"She won't go."

"That's kind of weird isn't it? Turning down a free cruise?"

"Let me know what you decide."











I felt the clock eat away at us diligently as we ran around trying to ignore the bitemarks.

Explaining why my work was lackluster is pretty difficult. What did I want out of it? I went to school to do it, a determination to "succeed". But what I really wanted was to live the way I wanted to live. To be free from the work and grind each of these cogs assaulted on each other. SO I worked, and project timelines slipped, untli I was knee deep in requests and chages to our project that I didn't related to.

























On the platform was a performer dressed in a full suit playing drums. He sang reggae as he played. I didn't know him but that man had troubles and all that I'm sure. Otherwise he wouldn't play Jamaican music in the subway. But watching him closely, his eyes were loose and unsettled staring every which way, I was unsure how he could play calming music. ((I wondered if he was climbing out of his hole or further in it.)) A friend of mine form university learned how to play the marimba in Zimbabwe. I asked her what thier songs were about since the high notes sounded so chipper. But they were all depressing songs, abuot mourning and death. Maybe this Jamacican man was winging it.
