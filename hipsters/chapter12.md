A month didn't fly by. I felt it wriggling in my gut everyday. There were no fights, barely any orders. Some of the people we knew patted me on the back, others simply apologized and ran away. But most of all no one said anything.

The second moving van that day cancelled for a third time. Everything was barely packed into boxes though. Renee sat on one of them and we waited for her ceremony leader now. He promised to take some of it off our hands.




I kind of wanted the cat. But it was the type of cat where one day it would lie on you and you'd pet it, and unexpectedly it would bite your hand maliciously and evaporate under the bed. Kind of like every cat.



Finally, at the end of the day I watched her van leave. She walked out of the story she was never a part of.








I met them at the bar. The duo from Agnostic Tattoo were playing that night, along with Almost Dead Flamingos and No Razors. I sat with them, distraught but far away. A heavy feeling lay in my stomach. I wasn't sure if I was relieved or exhausted. This feeling inhibited me, wanting to throw things until I was tired, and then afterwards throw more things.


Most of the night wasn't a blur, surprisingly. Lying on the floor, crying was an issue.
