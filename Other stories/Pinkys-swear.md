Pinky's swear
 
The stiff-necked colonel was caught up with the facts. Arriving in a dark black tweed suit, his rank pinned on it, gun in his pocket, head shaven, he scanned the crowded lawn across the cemetery devoid of expression. Standing like a lighthouse in a sea of his old hometown's folk, too many recognizable marked memories.
 
The mourners stood in groups. Some surrounded his mother's casket, some a flower patch or a bench. All moved together except the colonel. He'd encountered them all at some point. They remembered the colonel as squat, plump, round and poignant. They knew him as Pinky too, because that's what his mother called him since the day he was born. So he had to deal with his name on top of dealing with all the other people dealing with him. He always thought of his mother as a jovial mess and a ridiculous person. His father, on the other hand, treated him as a neccessary ration.
 
"This is where her past lived," he said dramatically to himself. "It's just unfortunate it happened for so long." He cast stern quick glances at people. Half of them wore dull comforting smiles, others he saw as completely mortified. That's when he knew these were amateurs.
 
His family, former rivals and the rest of these horrible people Pinky knew from years past said their condolences to him. Their apologies lingered in his ears as he weaved through the crowd, nodding. He didn't say a word, nor will he, he mused. A few people like his aunt, his cousin, his old neighbor all tried to engage him in a conversation but to no avail. His silence went on until he reached his father.
 
The rock that Pinky remembered as his father's face was molten down then frozen again. The years were not kind to him, perhaps even a bit abusive. Pinky and his father exchanged only a few select words anyway. They exhausted all the rest of them in shouts growing up. His father's sentences were hard, shallow and grief stricken. He took them in numb wanting to finish the ordeal. Pinky's words were firmly consoling, dotted with a 'sir'.
 
He walked to a seat in front of where the procession was to begin and sat, adjusting to a complacent and confident stature. The necessity of it all was slightly discomforting, even he had to admit. But not to anyone, even himself. Still, Pinky's mother's funeral cast a long and abysmal shadow on him. It was enough to at least knock on the door of his insecurities.
 
Pinky felt someone shift besides him. Looking out of the corner of his eye he did a subtle double take on who. Someone he hadn't seen since he was sixteen. He barely recognized the man now with a beard topped with a porkpie hat. This town is worse than he remembered, "these people don't even have any shame for the annoying dead." He wanted to shove the porkpie in this man's face, just for spite. But he held that back, commandeering.
 
"May I ask how long have you've been in service?" The man said, after leaning forward, inquisitively, and catching a glimpse of his front pocket's medals.
 
"Twenty three years." recited Pinky blandly.
 
The man pulled out an old stop watch after fishing deep in his jacket then sighed. He clicked it open and read, as if he were reading Pinky's resume. "You enjoy it, I hope?"
 
"It's for the service of my country and countrymen. There's no higher honor." 
 
The man smirked a tiny but indiscreet smile into his watch. Then with a deeper sigh, "Honor" He repeated.
 
Pinky wasn't sure if he should be ruffled, but at that point everyone was already getting in their seats around Pinky. They settled down slowly, waiting to begin. The porkpie man inquired. Easily a hundred people hushed their children.
 
But. As Pinky adjusted, then pondering the sea of gravestones behind the podium, "What is this mood I'm in?" He asked.
 
"Melancholy maybe?"
 
"Melancholy?! W-"
 
"It's kind of a cycle, I guess. It's terribly depressing, but that's beside the point. The entire atmosphere is depressing after someone dies. The mere image of the casket poisons the air, gets us intoxicated."
 
"What are you implying?" Pinky's face reddened as he barely thought over the pork pie's comments. "Are you insulting my-"
 
"She didn't even want to be buried, did you think of that? She wanted her body donated to medical school. To science."
 
Pinky's Dad coughed, tapping the microphone on his hip like a maestro and raising it like a magician. Aiming it at Pinky. Everyone quieted around him. Pinky obeyed too but with clenched confused fists.
 
The children either got busy watching their shoes swinging or sweating out the summer sun quite ready to rough house eachother. But the adults were quite ready to get on with it, licking their chapped lips in the heat.
 
Pinky's father began doling out his introductions like the catering working in the background; One at a time he brought out each memory to his grieving audience, the quality of each questionable. They all sat comfortably, except Pinky, as his father picked off their names and hammered them into a scenario with Pinky's mother.
 
Pinky was still hard pressed to dismember the pork pie man verbally. The more he thought about the man, he realized he barely remembered who this man was. "What kind of familiar ghost are you?" he asked himself, as the man with the porkpie hat watched his father patiently with a sad pouting face. Pinky muddled his words his head trying to make sense of them. They came up hazy. Methodically, he chose to ignore the words until the end. Pinky had his pistol on him. He could intimidate him easily.
 
A neglected toddler waddled into Pinky's view a few disturbing feet away. Someone's daughter perhaps. She hid behind people's chairs and from an invisible opponent playfully but in tears. Pinky watched her a bit. Her faded pink dress. Her surly very light short blonde hair. He tried to focus on his dad's moronic speech but the toddler then took the steps in front of him, her wide green eyes with tears overflowing down her cheeks, completely silent. He motioned her away but she remained stationary.
 
After his father finished he called up who'd like to give their condolences and stepped aside. Pinky held his own but he felt antsy. With each who approached the podium were easily in their late seventies and eighties escorted by their middle aged son or daughter, like a lagging parade.
 
Mr. Cusak stepped up to the podium, then the flower shop lady, then another from a local supermarket. It seemed his mother touched the lives of everyone in that small town, "or was this not their first time at a podium, they're so used to it they eulogized each other?" These thoughts played in his mind, which slowly began shifting back to work. Every so often the man in the hat would sniffle loudly to wake Pinky from his daydream.
 
"She was an angel. Just ask Mrs. Cusak... Right Peggy? Do you remember how many times she helped us with our garden? She stuck it out even in the heat. Always bringing her pie when she visited on Sundays too. Every damn time she had to bake that pie that morning before she came over... Can you taste it Peggy? You remember that pie? We take that pie to heart. I was sick of it by the end honestly, it might be what killed her too!" then smacking the air dryly, "Ah no, that's my joke."
 
Others, like his scout master Mr. Tofall, all smiles besides his tears and warts, went up to speak afterwards.
 
"I'm sorry..." the toddler in front of him whispered.
 
"Go away," he whispered back impatiently through his teeth fanning her to leave.
 
It was hard to ignore both of them, especially with the ceremony going as slow as it was. The long draul of each person serenading his mother was a bad combination for him. Again he motioned the girl, but she only moved closer. He looked around for a parent, but couldn't see anyone claiming her. He tried to ignore the girl, feeling the sweat and his forehead began to bead from the hot sun. But suddenly a feminine hand materialized dobbing it with a cool handkerchief. "Who-" Pinky began, realizing he was so startled he was ready to pounce out of his seat.
 
The second shock came when she placed her hand on his shoulder. The touch surprised Pinky so much it made him jump, circling around to see a brunette's long dark hair brushing his back. Her face was obviously hot from the sun, but her gaze was off, staring down into space somewhere lost. 
 
The lady only slowly began petting his head. The cool palm rubbing his skull softly like cleaning a dish. Her other hand caught his before he could reach out to her, and she looked in his eyes. Her eyes smiled sadly into his, and they calmed him. Her finger pointed at his nose, then on his lips. The crying girl's whimpers were becoming more grating to him, a soft but sick rhythm.
 
"Shhhh."
 
"Do I know you?"
 
"Your mother is in a better place." She whispered to him, massaging his arm.
 
"Please, I'd rather not talk about my mother." Pinky said.
 
The lady sighed and looked frustrated, and her eyes again floated away into space. "It's hard not to talk about it now."
 
"Can you please be quiet," He whispered, lulled by the sun and the hands, he closed his eyes "We are at a funeral." He could hear Mr. Tofall's hard voice breaking down. His slow sobs steadily grew more in focus. His voice almost broke the spell Pinky was under.
 
But what really undid it was how hard the long haired brunette started to massage his eyes, carelessly pushing hard on them aching his head. "Softer please," he cried, but she ignored him, until he felt pain, like marbles borrowing in his sockets. He grabbed her hands and raised them forcefully.
 
He realized just then he'd lost the feeling of the gun in his pocket. He felt naked without it. Someone must have disarmed him. In a sudden panic he got up. He was faced to face with her, her eyes were dreamy, somber, almost fainting. She looked back at him sadly, and he realised it irritated him incredibly.
 
"Did you steal my gun?" He had to talk over the crying toddler whining louder still.
 
"Do you need it at your mother's funeral?" She sighed, looking back at him in a daze.
 
"I need it everywhere. Did you steal it? I'll have you arrest-"
 
"Calm down now." The man with the porkpie hat snapped his fingers, "There's no need for violence here."
 
"I'm the law here, whoever you are. You'll address me as-"
 
"As what? Your mother is lying there dead in her grave. She didn't even want a funeral and you're sitting here pretending you care about her."
 
The toddler wrapped around his leg, her face draining her tears into a puddle on his pants. "What the he-..." but redirected at the brunette and the man in the porkpie hat, "What the hell business is it of yours?"
 
"It's _your_ business." The man muttered, staring straight at him. "You don't deserve a salute Colonel, you let this happen to her."
 
This only made Pinky madder, his face redder than most combined. It was already burning from the heat, but now was fully lit like a burner and his ears were the tips of the flame. All his restraint couldn't hold him back, and he grabbed the pork pie man by the collar.
 
"Who are the fuck are you?"
 
But as he blurted it out a pain stung him in his ankle. The toddler began first with small nibbles but then hard bites piece emeal, teeth mark holes breaks the seams of his pants. Blood drooled down his foot soon enough.  The brunette lady got behind him with what appeared to be a sad hunger, peppering his shoulder with spit. She climbed on his back as he turned in circles trying to grab her or her dress. She bit at his sweaty red neck in haste.
 
"Get off of me!" He wheezed out between a breath. With Pinky off guard, the pork pie man grabbed the back of one of Pinky's arm and twisted it hard with surprising hidden strength. "Get off of me! I'll have you bastards arrested."
 
"You're at your own mother's funeral." The porkpie man hit him in his stomach, knocking out the wind in Pinky while the other two flailed around him. "Show... Some respect... For your mother."
 
"I'm a damn colonel you bitch. Get off of me!" He tried to hook his arm around the brunette woman's head, anything to get a better hold of her, but she slipped out of his sweating palms' reach and started chowing on his ear. He screamed in pain as he felt her teeth grind it. Pinky fell to the ground while the toddler began gnawing on his right knee. 
 
But Pinky finally got his footing, and managed to pry the brunette off his shoulder, dragging the little girl against the grass and dirt from his knee. Staggering to get up, the man with the porkpie hat put him in a headlock. "Your mother was a saint, she was always there for you!" he yelled, kneeing Pinky hard in the stomach.
 
"My mother..." Pinky finally took to his military training. "I'm so glad she's dead. She never understood how much I hated-" And with a punch to the face the man with the porkpie hat man was on the ground having his hat fall off. "She only cared about herself and her stupid neighbors and friends. She was never there for me." And while kick the bald man in the face, the brunette clawing at him, he yelled clearly,
 
"You can all go to hell like my mother!"
 
The swear echoed the garden, running through it gallantly like an olympic triumph. Pinky suddenly realized what he unleashed, and to his horror the wrinkles and aghasts on people's faces were petrified, making them appear more prominent. Some people's mouths were upended in wide o's coupled with glaring eyes. Everyone stood stone white for a moment. Pinky's world stood still. A twisted ode hung above them all.
 
Sensing a familiar presence, Pinky knew before even looking that his aunt was staring right through him. Into his exasperated face he saw her shock. The family! Our Town! Pinky's humility! His words dumped all of those into oblivion, and he stared down at them as they fell, mouth agape. He reached out, but his his hands were too  far greased with sweat. So they only strained through his fingers.
 
His father stepped up behind a crowd, slowly. He was distilled in an agony only a parent could know, ashamed and betrayed, having just watched Pinky cast aside all his life lessons. "Why, son?!" He barely said, overstricken by grief. Pinky tried to mouth something, but it only appeared as an imaginative gesture. The many shocked hating eyes froze those words and nailed them deep down his gullet.
 
Who accompanied his father but two of Pinky's kindergarten teachers! Their arms hooked together just moments ago, soon fell to their sides. One raised her hands to the sky to ask, as if in a prayer to the past moment, how could he tarnish, how could he be such a horrible child?
 
Right behind them though, was his high school class queuing up, their ears obviously perked up to Pinky's descent. They had exaggerated surprised expressions on their faces with slightly curled smiles. They enjoyed his fall.
 
Cousins, uncles, family friends, teachers, butchers, shopkeepers, mailmen, carnival game touters. The town's parade of humility battered at him, their stares flogging him, one blow after the other.
 
And then, even in death, his mother appeared before him exactly as if she were alive. She wore a particularly ugly dress with its own brand of horror. Unfashionable even in death, it made him even more depressed. Her body was frail, but stressed like her face, writhing in agony of disappointment. The look on her face was enough to melt him. "How could you..." the ghost whispered silently to the still air, then evaporated before him.
 
***
 
As The last of his family left, ignoring Pinky as he lay on the ground with his face in the shade of his mother's tombstone. His mind was exhausted at his attempts for mercy. Everyone left him there sulking. It was the least they could do after he begged for their forgiveness, to let him sulk without dignity. Defeated.
 
He was too tired and cried too much to be useful to anyone.
 
A blonde man approached him in stride of confidence. His hair was wavy, gelled and combed back. His suit fit perfectly, was clean cut. He wore a finely shaved stubble around his cheeks and chiseled jaw.
 
"Calm down." The blonde man tilted his head compassionately.
 
"Where were you when I needed you?"
 
"I was at the buffet. You need to get up." reaching out to him nonchalantly.
 
Pinky's hands were red with calluses. They stung so much from pulling at people's shirts, suspenders and dresses begging for forgiveness. So he hooked a pinky to the blonde man's. It pulled him up effortlessly.
 
They look in each other's eyes and Pinky whispered "Thank you."
 
"Thank for being there to be there with." the blonde man smiled generously, showing his wide toothed grin. Their pinkies tightened their embrace. They noded together "Never again. Friends forever."
