Pinky's swear

The stiff-necked colonel was caught up with the facts. Arriving in a dark black tweed suit, his rank pinned on it, head shaven, he scanned the crowded lawn across the cemetery devoid of expression. He was a rock in a sea of his old hometown's folk. Too many recognizable mixed memories. They stood in groups. Some surrounded his mother's casket, some a flower patch or a bench.

He'd encountered them all at some point. They all remembered the colonel as squat, plump, round and poignant. They knew him as Pinky too, because that's what his mother called him since the day he was born. So he had to deal with his name on top of all the other people dealing with him. That defined their relationship too. He always thought of his mother as a jovial mess and a ridiculous person. His father treated him as a neccesary ration.

"This is where his past lived", he thought solemnly to himself, "It's just unfortunate it happened for so long, but I'll bury it and will bury it almost forever now."

Pinky's mother's funeral cast a long and abismal shadow. It was enough to at least knock on the door of his insecuirities. He cast stern quick glances at people. Half of them wore dull comforting smiles, others were completely mortified. That's when he knew these were amatuers.

His family, former rivals and the rest of these horrible people Pinky knew from years past said their condolences. Their apologies lingered in his ears as he weaved throuh the crowd, nodding. He didn't say a word, nor will he, he thought. A few people like his aunt, his cousin, his old neighbor all tried to engage him in a conversation but to no avail. His silence went on until he reached his father.

The rock that Pinky remembered as his father's face was molten down then frozen again. The years were not kind to him, perhaps even a bit abusive. Pinky and his father exchanged only a few select words anyway. The exhausted all the rest of them in shouts growing up. His father's sentences were hard, shallow but grief stricken. He took them in with grace, numb and wanting to finish the ordeal. Pinky's words were firmly consoling, dotted with a 'sir'.

He walked to a seat in front of where the procession was to begin and sat. A complacent and confident stature. The necessity of it all was slightly discomforting, even he had to admit it. But not to anyone, even himself. There was a long pause filled with a void of thoughts.

Pinky felt someone shift besides him. Looking out of the corner of his eye he did a subtle double take on who was next to him. Someone he hadn't seen since he was sixteen and down and out in the middle of middle school. He barely recognized the man now with a beard and a monocole saddled in his eye topped with a porkpie hat.

He thought, it was worse than he remembered, these people had no shame for the dead. He wanted to shove the porkpie in this man's face, to for the grief of it all. But he held that back, commandeering.

"May I ask how long have you've been in service?" The man said, after leaning forward, inquisitively, and catching a glimpse of his front pocket's medals.

"Twenty three years." recited Pinky blandly.

The man pulled out an old stop watch after fishing deep into his jacket, then sighed. He clicked it open and read it, as if he were reading Pinky's resume. "You enjoy it, I hope?"

"It's for the service of my country and countrymen. There's no higher honor." 

The man smirked a tiny but indiscreet into his watch. Then with a deeper sigh, "Honor" He repeated.

Pinky wasn't sure if he should be ruffled, but at that point everyone was already getting in their seats around Pinky. They settled down slowly, waiting to begin.

But. As Pinky pondered the sea of gravestones in behind his father's podium, "What is this mood I'm in?"

"Melancholy maybe?" The porkpie man inquired.

"Melancholy?! W-" Pinky started in a deep commanding voice, but was interrupted.

"It's kind of a cycle, I guess. It's terribly depressing, but that's beside the point. The entire atmosphere is depressing after someone dies. The mere image of the casket poisons the air, gets us intoxicated."

"What are you implying?" Pinky's face reddened as he barely thought over the porkpie's comments. "Are you insulting my-"

"She didn't even want to be buried, did you think of that? She wanted her body donated to medical school. To science."

Pinky's Dad coughed, tapping the microphone on his hip like a maestro and raising it like a magician. Aiming it at Pinky. Everyone quieted around him. Pinky obeyed too but with clenched confused fists. Easily a hundred people hushed their children kjust a minute before the proceedings started. The children either got busy watching their shoes swinging or sweating out the summer sun quite ready to rough house eachother. But the adults were quite ready to get on with it, licking their chapped lips in the heat.

Pinky's father began dolling out out his speech like the catering working in the background; One at a time he brought out each memory to his grieving audience, the quality of each questionable. They all sat comfortably, except Pinky, as his father picked off their names and hammered them into a scenario with Pinky's mother.

"She was an angel. Just ask Mrs. Mortimer, right Peggy? Do you remember how many times she helped you with your garden? I was sick of it by the end honestly, but she stuck out. It might be what killed her too!" he smacked the quiet warm air dryly, "Ah no, that's my joke. Sigfried! She always brought her pie when she visited you. Every damn time she had to bake that pie that morning before we came over... Can you taste it Sig? You remember that pie? I hope you took that pie to heart." 

Pinky was still hard pressed to dismember the porkpie man verbally. What kind of familiar ghost was he, but also someone all too real in front of him? The man watched his father patiently with a sad pouting face.

Pinky muddled porkpie's words in his head trying to make sense of them. He took it lightly when they came up hazy. Very methodical, he chose to ignore the words and try to let them pass through him, because they didn't help him. The more he thought about him, teh more he realized he barely remembered who this man was.

Pinky noticed a neglected toddler wondered in his direction. She waddled into Pinky's view a few disturbing feet away. Someone's daughter perhaps. She hid behind people's chairs and from an invisible opponent playfully. Pinky watched her a bit. Her faded pink dress. Her surly short blonde hair. He tried to fucs on his dad but she just stood there, her wide green eyes with tears overflowing down her cheeks, completely silent. He motioned her away but she remained stationary.

After his father finished he stood aside and called up the next in line. Afterwards Pinky could feel his bald head begin to sweat and wiped his brow. With each who approached the podium were easily in their late seventies and eighties escorted by a character, like a lagging parade.

 Each person who stepped up to remind them of Pinky's mother was acompanied by an estranged character that somehow fit into his life. The shopkeeper, old Mr. Cusak, with a grey mustache like a comb, was escorted to the microphone by a fat essence of a human. A big round thick glassed man shuffled through the crowd behind Mr. Cusak was difficult to forget.

 Others, like his scout master Mr. Tofall, was all smiles besides his tears and warts, went up to speak. He was followed closely behind by a ginger girl, her tears raged down her face like lit fires as she lightly knashed her teeth.

"I'm sorry" the toddler in front of him whispered.

"Go away," he whispered back imaptiently through his teeth fanning her to leave.




















Pinky was not one to make a scene but he panicked uncontrollably. All of these people around him, their faces at first gilded but soon he saw them for what they really were. Distractions and incantations for his passions. Without words. He grabbed Melancholy by the ear and sang into it an obsenity and pushed him back, thrusting him off his chair onto the dry grass.



Soon they were approaching him from all sides and eventually dogpiled him. They sat and fought on top of him as he flailed kicks and screams into the mass. Curses and swears erupted from his throat in a panic. A finger reddening his eye, a choke in his throat, he chest tightening and heaving, an incredible pressure pushing out deep breathes and tears. They beat them out of him more like an old cushion wheezing out dust after hit with a thick stick.

No one around him could hear him though until he said, "Go to hell like my mother!"










The swear echoed the halls of the garden, running through them galantly like an olympic triumph to Pinky's horror. The aghasts on people's faces were withered and worn down, making them more prominent. Some people's mouths were upended in wide o's with glaring eyes. The world stood still. Everyone stood stone white for a moment. An ode. etc.

Sensing a familiar ((pretense,")), Pinky turned around, before even looking he already knew his boss was staring right through him. Into his exasperated face he saw the horror. The investors! The board members! The entire company! Pinky's humility! His words dumped all of those into oblivion, and he stared down at them as they fell, mouth agape. He reached out, but their sweat and tears greased his hands and they only strained through his fingers.

Then to Pinky's horror, his father stepped up behind a crowd. Slowly, with limps in both his legs. He was distilled in an agony only a parent could know, ashamed and betrayed, having just watched Pinky cast aside all his life lessons. "Why, son?!" He barely said, overstricken by grief. Pinky tried to mouth I'm sorry, but it only appeared as an imaginative gesture. The many hating eyes froze those words and nailed them down in his gullet.

Who accompanied his father were Pinky's two kindergarten teachers. Their arms hooked together just a moment ago, soon fell to their sides. One raised her hands to ask, in the air, as if in a prayer to the past moment, how could he tarnish, how could he be and ((that))?

Right behind them though, was his high school class queuing up, their ears obviously perked up to Pinky's descent. They had exaggerated surprised expressions on their faces with slightly curled smiles. They enjoyed this moment.

Cousins, aunts, uncles, family friends, teachers, butchers, shopkeepers, mailmen, Carnival game touters. The parade of humility battered at him, their stares flogging him and he, on the floor while his many otehr unpleasant hes (emotions) beat on top of him in turns, one blow after the other.

And then, even in death, his mother appeared before him exactly as if she were alive. The look on her face is enough to melt him. She wore a particularly ugly dress wth its own brand of horror. And unfashionable even in death, it made him even more depressed. Her body was frail, but strewn up now like her face, writhing in agony of disappointment. "How could you..." the ghost whispered silently to the still air, then evaporated.

The curtain is slowly lifted, and Pinky begged for mercy after pushing aside the taut fat man with the porkpie and cane.

He was at a loss for words. He imagined they too died somewhere and were laughing with his ((mother)) in abstract hell.




A story about a man named pinky who swears at a pivotal moment (e.g. Everyone is quiet at a party but suddenly he isn't, in front of his boss's kid, etc.)











And then he said it.







Immediately, silence.



Over his career he dropped all kinds of bombs, but nothing could attribute to the casualties




----------

Pinky curled up in a ball, hands and fingers in deft ((defeated?)) agony.

((Maybe has a small conversation on what happened and laugh about it. Don't realize how many ppl you know, or how many people really matter.))

His good friend walks over ((atonement? relief?)) and tells him to calm down. Pinky squating and leaning against the wall, is too mentally exhausted to move.

His friend extends his hand, and Pinky reaches but he can't open his hands. They are too tired and sore from all of the pleading, pulling on people's suspender straps begging for forgiveness. So, awkwardly, his friend grabs his pinky by pinky, and raises him up. And up he goes, relieved. His small finger could carry him up and finally, something he could count on.



They look in eachother's eyes and Pinky says "Thank you for being there for me."

"Thank for being there to be there with." And their pinkies tighten their embrace one more time. "Friends forever."









point of the story is to ignore what people say and listen to your feelings

He literally wrestles with his emotions.

At first he doesn't feel much of anything, then starts to feel regret, depression, etc.














Someone behind him placed a cold hand lightly on his shoulder. A touch he hadn't felt in years. Even through his white shirt and the fabric of his crappy tweed suit he could feel the warmth capturing his body, consuming it like an alien. But it was so long ago. So not knowing whether to lean into it or cringe, he simply moved his shoulder slightly, shifting awkwardly, wanting to keep it on but somehow numb it.



...



One of them, leaning in to Pinky, slowly peeled back one of his sweaty cuffs and began to nibble on his wrist. Pinky was aghast and surprised beyond words, but very oddly lulled.



How unsettling it all was was incredible. The red head, like a cartoon, pulled out a set of plastic utensils, took out a shaker and salted his leg with drool.







Pinky grabbed the first 



His childhood friends, enemies, fellow boy scouts and drop outs. People who yelled at him while he grew up. Those who hated him as a child for being a child as he dreamt of etching revengeful marks into their cars but he never did.
