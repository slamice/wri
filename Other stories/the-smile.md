The city turned itself over daily, well unrested. It never sleeps but is always tired. And on the train everyone wants a seat, most need it honestly, after the day everyday.




((The)) imaginations paint the city with an expressionist palate. It's as glossy as a picture. The street and buildings bleed into eachother fluidly, they acknowledge all the history and culture you could possibly want, and theyre always playing together for you. Just for you.
