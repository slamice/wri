write about childhood from different perspectives.

Mother:
=======

At this point I was quite sick of the florecent lights, they weren't really anything I could focus on. I knew my husband kept pushing the baseball against into my lower back but I could barely feel it, even when it was the wrong spot. His concern lingered.

The only thing I could count on was the pain. Persistent and sharp. I could imagine it laughing at me and my baby, my husband oblivious.

After a few eons of this a nurse knocked on the door, and decided calmly to guide me to __the__ room.


Nurse:
======

She expected, even invited, the exhaustion and the moaning that comes with every build up before the release. There was really no reason to alert the parents on how worried she was, she was well trained out of a habit like that.

After checking the measurements from the few tubes attached to Ms. Bohinc's arm, she took her by the hand and said quietly, "We should walk to the birth room now Maja".

Ms. Bohinc translated to her husband to stop pushing but he was already on his feet, sweating a bit with a worried face.

8 years working
16 patients seen
moans, crying, trying not to be desensitized
the mother's been here overnight
I came by bike
I wonder if I'll make it in time to get the last special baked bread
clean the empty incubators
On day off, love to play Tennis
I've done this job forever, that's why I do it


Father:
=======

How long he'd have to push he didn't know. That part of Maja's back was basically a wall. He could only tell when he pushed the baseball at the wrong angle and she cried out that it was hurting her spine.

A nurse, or maybe their nurse, approached them. He wasn't sure if it was theirs because they all looked the same to him, though he'd never tell his wife. White surgical masks on their faces, clothes a dull pink, pale and blonde. She said something in a hushed voice.

"Stop pushing." She yelled and sighed out quickly, "We're going now."



How involved in mothers life? Wife, involved for only two years though
Father is in hospital with her
Clothes from the day before, feels a bit damp and sweaty
Last ate almond joy from the machine
What to smell? Hospital bed :(
Can hear Wife's moaning
Wife and nurse are with me, in adjacent room covered by a cloth another couple
Feeling exhausted and tired
Hope to be healthy, happy
Father's biggest fear is meeting expectations



Baby:
=====

If the walls around you contracted, forced you out, and into a descent, where would you go? Is there a place to go? Or do things just get tighter and tighter, while one wall behind you is nudging your neck over and over.

"Please." it says, "Please get out."

"But why would I have to go anywhere? Everything I have had or ever had is already here?" Ana thought at it hard, but that part of the wall lay blissfully ignorant as it poked her neck slowly moving down.




Understand it's not going to be comfortable
Hearing lots of gurgling, moaning
Feeling depressed, anxious
definitely can't think of food right now
Baby knows her mother is caring
Excited about ending the next thing
biggest fear is change
