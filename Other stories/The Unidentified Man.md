I leaned against a train platform pillar while I waited, humblely. It was late and people were draining the station gradually, trickling drops and drips.

It was an still is a huge station plagued with space but he was so engrossed in himself he didn't see where he was going until he ran into me. I don't remember how the conversation started after excuse me.




He loathed identification, because it didn't tell his entire story. His face, he thought, looked like a mugshot. People often mistook him for other ethnicities, and he enjoyed it. An American but from Italy, from Germany. A Bulgarian American, only the great great great grandson of a Bulgarian American.

He told me I didn't understand, or it was just difficult for me to understand? What he had been through. Difficult. 

"We are tribes."

"Tribes?""

"Yes," he closed his eyes solemnly, "Tribes who follow religions, ideologies, cults, none of them matter." He held his coffee close, his shoulders were tense but the rest of his body relaxed. When he spoke one of palms opened up in a gesture as if he were physically pushing his ideas forward. But I watched his hand again and again present me nothing.

"That's why I love America so much. The idea is beautiful. Everyone abandons their past, gets together and recreates themselves in any image they want." His hand went up, painting their images in the air.

"Aren't Americans a tribe then?"

"Well, yes of course we're a tribe. The American tribe. The great American tribe. We all chose to be here and that, THAT" he knocked hard on the table "is an American."

"Well the native indians are Americans too."

"Well of course, and they are so lucky to live "

One day though he disappered. I hadn't seen him in weeks. Not slinking across the streets. No exagerrated expressions and full of banter. I admit, I began to worry.

A body was found of someone. The evidence showed the body was heading home but was caught in the middle of a shoot out. An unintentional or intentional bullet hit him directly in the face, effectively exploding its details. No one was there to witness the assailants.

Being dead, the body made quite an impression now. I myself even came forward to try and identify it, but it was impossible. What remained was very disguting. The figure was unrelatable.

A charity took pity and volunteered to bury him. They marked the grave with their churches' symbol, and on his gravestone were the two letters D and D, standing for deary departed.
