Her dormitory bed was somehow more minimalist than others. A towel covered the entire thing and then a thin sheet on top of that. I remember it better than her room, which was mostly empty. It's where we lie thinking, holding hands. Her hand was warm and was the softest thing in mine. Fully clothed, mulling life, the future and our relationships to the world.

Her boyfriend was a popular topic. Another time She found two tickets to a movie, a bad one, in his wallet when he went back to Korea.

"It's too obvious. Is he just careless?"

"I don't know, maybe?" Her voice rose at the end of each sentences, half a whine. It was grating but very cute.

"This movie was so horrible, maybe they didn't watch it and they did something else." We laughed, her nervously. We were so innocent we couldn't even bring ourselves to contemplate the words behind that possibility. We talked about his broken Korean, how caring and humble his mother was. A devout christian widow, set up a separate room for her to sleep in when she visited. She told me about their cat sat on her face often at night, and they made her allergic een though she swore she wasn't before.


















Around exams she invited me over to study, but her room was so warm I fell asleep without reluctance on her bed while she studied at her desk. She never found it amusing and kicked me out when she needed to sleep.




We made up excuses on what our long hugs meant, and how no one cheated.

((I passed, and got a great few jobs, married, with a daughter))



We made a promise to eachotehr that, if we weren't married by thirty, we'd marry each other.



Promise of not marrying anyone else until 30. Very juvinile.

....

When she said that, I was wondering if she was making my daughter an accessory to the crime ((against my promise)).

Old friend from university leaves, he pines for her later but he's married.
