"Rockerfeler center is open."

"I can't ice skate there. I had a very, ~bad~ experience." her accent pronounced every C like an S, and every S was mutilated, ground to dust while her tongue pushed against the back of her teeth.

"What happened?"

Sullenly, she replied "I used to be engaged to someone named David. He owned a massage business. We dated for three years, and finally he took me ice skating there, and proposed to me. I didn't know exactly what to do. It must have cost so much, and everyone was staring at me, and I said yes, but my Dad, he said no."

"So what did you do?"

"What could I do~~~? We broke up. No poi~nt! I still can't skate there. It's really bad memory."

She recited the story naturally, upset but accepting.

"What if, we made a new memory there? A happier memory?"

"I'm sorry Poco, but I can't do it. It's there and it's been there for a long time. I didn't date anyone for years after that. That's life, you kno~w?"





She loved the bed, more than I remembered. She snuggled in the covers and 



"You didn't marry him because of your father?"









Her eyes stared at me and smiled, and her mouth smiled, and I found it hard to not to look away.

"You love me!" she yelled, and slapped my arm. "Poco loves me. Oh Poco, the best Romance ~ever~" and as she laughed her hair fell in her face.
































Her dormitory bed was somehow more minimalist than others. A towel covered the entire thing and then a thin sheet on top of that. I remember it better than her room, which was mostly empty. It's where we lie thinking, holding hands. Her hand was warm and was the softest thing in mine. Fully clothed, mulling life, the future and our relationships to the world.

Her ex-boyfriend then was a popular topic. Another time She found two tickets to a movie, a bad one, in his wallet when he went back to Korea.

"It's too obvious. Is he just careless?"

"I don't know, maybe?" Her voice rose at the end of each sentences, half a whine. It was grating but very cute.

"This movie was so horrible, maybe they didn't watch it and they did something else." We laughed, her nervously. We were so innocent we couldn't even bring ourselves to contemplate the words behind that possibility. We talked about his broken Korean, how caring and humble his mother was. A devout christian widow, set up a separate room for her to sleep in when she visited. She told me about their cat sat on her face often at night, and they made her allergic een though she swore she wasn't before.


Around exams she invited me over to study, but her room was so warm I fell asleep without reluctance on her bed while she studied at her desk. She never found it amusing and kicked me out when she needed to sleep. It was just routine to her.


----------------

She dictated me the whole day play by play until I stood in front of her hotel room. It was weird remembering who she was, A walking memory, or in her case a stationary memory, sitting diseased with melancholy sprinkled with ironic giggles. I knew she thought it too, we both did, how the city shadowed anywhere either of us went. We were together awkwardly closing in on eachother, in no hurry.

"Haitham!" She screamed out in joy when I knocked, and she screamed it again when we hugged and turned in circle after circle, carrying her light body in an embrace. 

















































What did we mean to eachother, really? We never found out ((point of the story))




We made up excuses on what our long hugs meant, and how no one cheated.

((I passed, and got a great few jobs, married, with a daughter))



We made a promise to eachotehr that, if we weren't married by thirty, we'd marry each other.

----

Promise of not marrying anyone else until 30. Very juvinile.

....

When she said that, I was wondering if she was making my daughter an accessory to the crime ((against my promise)).

...

Looking back, 30 is a bit young right? Shouldn't we have said 40?

Maybe, I guess... It is a bit young, but not where I come from. 26 is pretty late.

I'll only ask this once, not to make it awkward as I tried to make it awkward.

"There are some things you can't share, like when ~someone~ fails. It's too close to them and they can't take it."

Old friend from university leaves, he pines for her later but he's married.

-----------

Travels alone.

----------

Never said I love you to her husband, neither did he say I love you to her.

----------

Casually mention kid and wife.

We walked through times square. She took less pictures than i remembered, and her neck wasn't as tall as I remembered because she wore a light beige sweater. It was practically skin colored, modestly soon. An illusion when I thought I saw something I shouldn't have. I was releived, honestly. Her memory was alive, in front of me.

The people milled around like pillbugs sniffing every corner of the square, which has never been a square, and we walked back, after a few pictures, quietly.







We went up to her room, the whole time, she looped her arm in mine, and we walked back. 

She went to the bathroom and came out in pajamas.

Do you think I changed? Am I different?

I hugged her in the bed, and then once when we got up. I knew I'd miss her, and she closed the door.

I got on the train, heading back over the bridge, over the river. 

-------------------

Every day I walked by the skating rink, and one day I finaly rented skates. Overpriced coming with an additional fee for a locker, a steal.

Gliding, sometimes wobbly, over the ice. Holding on to nothing. But then my legs began to piston and I went faster and faster, propelling me around the rink. Past the children out too late and past the couples skating between extremes. They silently glided along as if passively aggrivessively fighting or laughing at how bad they were clinging to each other. They all started to blur in my mind.

And then I remembered her bundled up, then in her pajamas going to sleep, and then her hand proping up her shaky head at dinner as she stared back at me. And then I began to cry.
