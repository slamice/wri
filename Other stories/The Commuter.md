Samir sat sullen, sunken on his seat. The cart sped down the tracks, pretty rocky as it threw itself into high gear.

The people around him are like him, everyone with a few stories. Some of their faces pock marked, others lost in their headphones, a few leaned up against the pole molding into it.

Samir lived near the last stop in the Bronx, and he took the train everyday. He lived with his mother and older brother, working at some kind of retail/furniture/foodery sweatshop. He sweat there during the lunch rushes, and then on his way home just to pass the time. He was a hairy guy too, that's important.

A few people got off the next stop, and then the next stop. Samir was so tired at 10 PM now. Earlier he ventured around the city disguising himself as a normal person. Within the throngs and gongs of Midtown, he walked eighty blocks for a reason. And he was tired enough to start the next day again.

The conductor began pronouncing the train stops delicately, with a joking coo. Every station name and _next stops_ were slowly getting a few chucklettes. A few got on and a few more got off.

"Nereld ave." was coming up. Samir didn't feel like moving. He moved a lot and didn't want to move anymore. He moved so much and didn't know where to go anymore.

So the doors slid open, a few people stepped off, and Samir just sat there. His flat butt cheeks kissed the seat through his jeans and he was undeterred. He didn't want to pass the corner stores. He didn't want to drag his feet seven more blocks to his walk up. At least not yet.

The moment fleeted. The doors closed and they moved on to 241st street. Samir sat there and wondered when he'd feel like getting up. If he had to cut up some more meat, find some more white tube socks with grey heels, fold more pants along the creases, he could at least stay one more minute on the train.

The announcer sang the last stop's "241st street" like a feminine bear and the doors yawned open. People slowly got up and began piling out. A few shifties, shifting, stayed on looking indifferent. An unusually happening Spanish family, who spoke no language, chatted each other to their seats. An older African lady simply shuffled like a few cards to the last of the rows.

The doors clicked closed and continued on, down a tunnel for quite a bit. Samir's eyes swung past beam after beam of the dark corridor. He stayed dreamily in his seat.

The tunnel soon opened up and the conductor, in a very heavy and muffled voice announced "South Kensington". An older gentleman in the corner got up and walked out the door. A small crowd high heeled and loafered into the car, looking high and like loaves. They laughed half drunk coughs. They had quite pasty and floury skin. One had an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth. They all spoke as if their mouths were full of bread and they were choking it down, laughing hard. The African lady simply snubbed her nose up and looked away.

Samir's eyebrow twitched in confusion. He felt himself waking up a bit, wondering if he was in a daze before. He looked out the subway car window and saw speckled yellow tiles. They were so clean he almost panicked. He gulped and held himself slowly, wondering who to gesture.

But suddenly the doors closed and the train continued on, down the tunnel again. He was sure he was on the same train ten minutes ago, and yet he had no idea where he was. Clues were standing around him spitting and shouting odd remarks back from a club.

Samir's English was anything but great, but it was good enough to break. He almost got up to approach the group in front of him, but sat back down when he realized he didn't how to ask what he didn't know to ask.

The train sped on down a long tunnel, the dark round greyness passing quicker and quicker, only the pipes remain constant. The people on th train was racketeering to themselves, the quiet lady in the corner shrunk and simply looked away to nothing. The spanish family chatted in brief spurts to each other. Samir studied all their faces. They were completely without any doubt. No one was surprised in teh least that the world suddenly changed.

The train announcer was barely audible above the static that suddenly crashed into the car, but Samir then heard a recorded voice but barely understood the accent, "The next station is Marble Arch". The same white walls glimmered and shined through palely.

Samir sat there, still, as the talkative bunch got off the train, bumbling. An older man balding man stepped on, brutally tired out of his mind. And then the train doors closed, and continued on.

Samir sighed. He wondered what kind of bizarre twighlight zone he was in. Maybe he was getting taken back, back to the end of the world, back to the destruction, back to his missing father. Anything could explain this really. He prayed to himself while the wooshing sound of the train nestled into his heart and punched it slowly form the inside, beating harder and harder. Samir sat there in silence, wishing he studied harder.

The train threw time behind it as it continued in the only direction it knew. It shooped and whooped down its runway in a hurry. The train conductor's voice grew harder and harder to understand. Samir began to give up when it announced "Cowcaddens" and "Ibrox". The doors flew open and closed, and the singles and families grew paler and paler. The Spanish family remained on the train, shuffling. The African American lady sat in the corner, reading a newspaper that somehow materialized out of her bag.
