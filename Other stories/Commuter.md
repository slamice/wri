Drilling into the Bronx noisily, the train shook like a heavy set man as it threw itself into high gear late into the night. Samir was sunk into his rigid plastic seat, tired. The other commuters drooped like him. The air was so thick with droops you heard the dripping off the seats puddle to the floor. Some of their faces, pock marked, stared blankly at nothing in particular. Other faces rested, listening and lost in their headphones. A few bodies molded themselves around the train poles. All were simply tired.

Samir's body exhausted. Today like everyday he labored around the city disguised as a normal person. Within the throngs and gongs of Midtown, He travelled hundreds of blocks for a reason. He was lucky to have a job and knew it. His days were spent hidden behind a salad bar breaking sweats through lunch rushes. Later, he panted over pants in a laundromat. Particularly hairy, the sweat clung to his back until dark and finally let go. One long wet pet.

At the end of most days his legs crawled like a determined rock. And he was tired enough to come back the next day. And the next. And everyday he rode the train for the past five months but recognized no one. And no one recognized him back.

After a while, the conductor began pronouncing the train stops delicately, with a joking coo. Every station name and _next stops_ were slowly getting a few chucklettes from the passengers, however minor.

N_____ ____ was coming up. Samir didn't feel like moving. He moved a lot and didn't want to move anymore. He moved so much and didn't know where to move to anymore.

So the doors slid open, A few people dragged themselves off, and Samir just sat there. He was undeterred. He didn't want to pass the corner stores. He didn't want to drag his feet seven more blocks to his walk up. At least not yet.

The train sped and the doors opened again. And the moment fleeted, closing and moving on. Samir sat there and wondered when he'd feel like getting up. If he had to cut up some more lettuce, fetch more white tube socks with grey heels, fold more pants along the creases, he could at least stay one more minute on the train.

The announcer sang the last stop's "_____ street" like a feminine bear and the doors yawned open. People slowly got up and began piling out. A few shifties, shifting, stayed on looking indifferent. An unusually happening Spanish family, fashionable and popular among their peers, chatted each other to their seats. An older African lady with a huge straw hat simply shuffled like a card to a corner.

Train doors clicked closed and continued on, down a tunnel for quite a bit. Samir's eyes swung past beam after beam of the dark corridor. He stayed dreamily in his seat, waiting for it to turn around.

The black corridor soon began flooding with bright florescent light. Hundreds of white tiles fevered on the walls until they covered them, and Samir's body twinged a bit in puzzle. His livid mind hadn't caught up with his environment yet, but it slowly grew a bit curious and surprised.

After five minutes the tunnel soon opened up and the conductor, in a very heavy and muffled voice announced "South Kensington". The doors swung open again, and an older gentle man in the corner violently got up and walked out the door. A small crowd high heeled and loafered into the car, looking as high as risen loaves. They laughed in between half drunk coughs. Their skin was quite pasty and floury. One had an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth. They all spoke as if their mouths were full of bread and they were choking it down, gafawing hard. The African lady in the corner simply snubbed up her nose and looked away.

Samir's eyebrow twitched in confusion. He felt himself waking up a bit. He looked out the subway car window. Speckled yellow tiles spread across the floor, accompanying the brightly lit tunnel. They were so clean he panicked. He gulped and held himself slowly, wondering who to ask or gesture what was going on, but because his English was so cut up it sat sad and crying nestled behind his tongue.

The doors closed abruptly and the train continued on, down the tunnel again. He was sure he was on the same train ten minutes ago, and yet he had no idea where he was. Clues were standing around him spitting and shouting odd remarks just back from the club. But they were for someone else.

Samir's English was usually weak enough to break. He almost got up to approach the group in front of him, but sat back down when he realized he didn't how to ask what he didn't know to ask. He thought the situation might correct itself in a few and held out a bit more, separate from the unpleasantries of the drunks.

Stop after bloody stop. Continuing on down a long tunnel, the brightness turned to dark round greyness. It passed quicker and quicker, only the pipes remained in constant view. The train full of rowdy racketeers now, the quiet straw hatted African lady in the corner simply looked beyond nothing. The Spanish family continued to chat in brief spurts to each other. Samir studied all their faces. They were completely without any doubt. No one was surprised in the least that the world kept changing.

The announcer was barely audible above the static that suddenly crashed into the car, but Samir then heard a recorded voice but barely understood the accent, "The next station is Marble Arch". The same white walls glimmered and shined through palely.

Samir sat there, still, as the talkative bunch got off the train, bumbling. An older man balding man stepped on, brutally tired out of his mind. And then the train doors closed, and continued on.

He wondered what kind of bizarre twilight zone he was in. Maybe he was getting taken back, back to the end of the world, back to the destruction. Anything could explain this really. He prayed while the whooshing sound of the train nestled into his heart and punched it slowly from the inside, beating harder and harder. Samir sat there in silence, wishing he'd studied english and biology harder.

They sped down the only direction they knew for hours. The train car shooped and whooped down its runway in a hurry. The train conductor's voice grew harder and harder to understand. Samir began to give up when it announced "Cowcaddens" and "Ibrox". A rhythm formed whenever the doors flew open and closed, while the newly arriving singles and families grew paler and paler. The Spanish family remained on the train, shuffling. The African American lady remained in the corner, reading a newspaper that somehow materialized out of her bag just a moment ago.

Eventually the tunnel lights grew lighter. Samir slumped as they flushed down deeper into the earth. They emerged out a tunnel, once again cleaner than any station he'd seen in New York. The train receiver twinkled out a few bright sounds, now suspiciously clear, and a low solemn voice pronounced "Valcarca" in a familiar accent. The Spanish family got out excitedly and a few small crowds orderly parked themselves on seats and in corners.

A small jet black haired kid sat next to Samir as his mother stood in front of him. The kid held out a flat aluminum papered stick between his fingers. "¿Chicle?" he offered. His mom glanced at both of them and smiled.

"No, thank you." Samir smiled back, but then he realized "Excuse me, excuse me. Where is here?"

"Qué?" she asked him.

"Where is here?" He asked her, hoping dreadfully she'd understand. He bit his mind nails.

"¿Qué? Eh, Barcelona. Barcelona." She said slowly in a half smile.

"English? You say English?" hopefully.

"Ah, siento. No Inglés" Her face puckered a sad smile. Her son looked out the window and Samir nodded out two thank yous. They sped down the bright fluorescent grey tunnel. Samir thought it half heartedly, and this far in the train was still in on its joke but not laughing as much.

As the people moved on and into each other so did Samir's sighs. People from all corners of the earth bobbled, hopped, dashed, dragged themselves into his car. Stations got dirtier then cleaner then dirtier again. The cars were packed with silent bodies or very bizarre ones. Eventually Samir tired of sitting. He began to feel stale and bland in addition to his nervous panic. After quietly making it through the entire train, taking him twenty or so minutes, he had reached the conductor's car.

He knocked on the door once, harder again, pulled at the handle, but there were no results. The dark glass on the door looked back at him, pitying but stern. Samir took a deep breathe and it did too. Save a handful of people's eyebrows, nothing gave Samir much notice. He felt a bit like a spirit but without the haunting. Like a failed ghost.

It must have been a good five hours since he got on. Since then he had hopped through all the train cars, memorized their numbers, but the situation was the same everywhere. He got sick of the doors opening and closing. He was tired of ducking by children, squeezing by businessmen. But mostly he was tired of sighing. Samir went back to the original car he was on. And while heavily distracted with disappointment and confusion, sleep took over him. Again slumped in a chair, he began to drift off to the rhythm of the car shaking as it ran on the tracks.

In another hour the train quieted down a bit more. The crowds began thinning out.

When his eyes opened it was just him and the only person who he recognized earlier, the older African American lady with her big hat. They ended up all alone, speeding down yet another dark corridor. Samir walked toward her hopefully, wondering with a heavy heart if she knew where they were headed. She noticed him lazily, pursed her lips and then dropped them. Then again with the lip judgement.

"Excuse?" Samir intended it shyly but it came out perverse. "Where is here?"

"We on the train honey." She said bluntly. A blank stare on Samir's face made her charge "ON. THE. TRAIN."

"Yes, ok. On train. But where?"

"You asking me? Why you asking me?"

"Where do we go?"

"It's ok, we goan hawm." She was quickly losing interest, her eyelids grew heavier and glanced back at her paper.

"It is not ok." Samir began to get angry at how cold she seemed to him, but he couldn't tell if it was New York that hardened him or her or even the train car. The lady didn't budge but then looked straight at him.

"Wha you mean?"

"Why it is ok? We go far. It's not ok. Where do you go?"

"No one forcing you ta stay here. You can ge' off anytime."

The train slowed to a stop and she got up pushing past him without another word, off at a station the conductor breathed something unpronouncable with. Between huge white pillars a sign read "Алекса́ндровский сад". As the doors closed he saw her hobble off.

Deserted, the train was empty to Samir. He didn't feel there was anyone driving it either. It was only him and the train.

He stayed for another hour, hating the doors opening and closing at places that meant nothing to him. Each time a door opened a new bland painting revealed itself. Black, grey, brick, with cracks or bathed in marble or pure white stone.

The next stop was deserted, and the train intercom didn't crackle on this time. The train stopped in exhaustion and Samir looked outside. Two signs, one on top of the other read the same but the words were in a different order, "도곡　Dogok　谷道".

He stuck his head out and looked up and down at the grey and white stripped lines. He didn't know when he'd see the grayish black hues of concrete and brick he was used to again. But at that point he didn't much care.

The doors stood open, mocking him for several minutes.

He stopped thinking. He looked out the train both ways. It felt eerily clean and completely silent. He took a step, and walked out. His shoes echoed squeaks in the tunnel. Until he headed up the stairs.

A few minutes later, a ringing closed the doors, and they were gone.




















It's a simple moral or rather, life story. You got it where I'm trying to show a fragmented migrant existence. There's a blatant effort to try to familiarize the reader with hopelessness and being lost. Interesting ambiguity is also such a great two words for what I'm trying to convey. Samir has to keep moving even when resting, displaced and exhausted going everywhere but anywhere familiar. He doesn't have a place and needs to embrace that to find one.

Do I need to elaborate on anything?
