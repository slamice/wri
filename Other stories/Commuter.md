Noisily borrowing into the Bronx, the train shook like a heavy set man as it threw itself into high gear late into the night.

Samir sank into his orange plastic seat, tired. Other commuters drooped like him. The air was so thick with droops you heard them dripping off the seats puddling on the floor. Some of their faces, pock marked, stared blankly at nothing in particular. Others rested, lost in their headphones. A few bodies molded themselves around the train poles, others' asses seeped into the creases between the seats.

Samir's body exhausted. Today like everyday he labored around the city disguised as a normal person. Within Midtown, he travelled hundreds of blocks for a reason. He was lucky to enough to get work and knew it. His days were spent hidden behind salad bars breaking sweats through lunch rushes. And later, he panted over pants in a laundromat. His body was particularly hairy, so everyday the sweat clung to his back until dark and then finally let go. One long wet pet.

And everyday he rode the train but recognized no one. And no one recognized him back.

The conductor coughed in, and Samir assumed he was bored because he began pronouncing the train stops delicately with a joking coo. Every station name and _next stops_ were slowly getting a few chucklettes from the passengers, however minor. "Nereid Avenue" was announced next with a quiet whine.

The steel doors slid open, and a few people dragged themselves off while Samir sat there. His body, and therefore he, was undeterred. He didn't want to pass the corner stores. He didn't want to drag his feet seven more blocks to his walk up. At least not yet.

The doors pried themselves open again, then moved on. Samir sat there and wondered when he'd feel like getting up. If he had to cut up any more lettuce, fetch any more white tube socks with grey heels then he could at least stay one more moment on the train.

The announcer sang the last stop's "Wakefield-241 street" and the doors yawned open. People slowly got up and began piling out. A few shifties only shifted, staying on looking indifferent. An unusually happening Spanish family, fashionable and popular among their peers, chatted each other to their seats. An older African lady with a huge straw hat simply shuffled like a card to a corner.

Samir's eyes swung past beam after beam in the dark corridor the train borrowed itself in. He stayed dreamily in his seat, waiting for the the turn to back track.

The tunnel soon began flooding with bright florescent light. Hundreds of white tiles fevered on the walls until they covered them, and Samir's body twinged a bit in puzzlement. His livid mind hadn't caught up with his environment yet, but it slowly grew a bit curious and surprised.

Soon the tunnel opened up and the conductor, in a very heavy and muffled voice announced "South Kensington". Breaking open again, the doors welcomed an older gentleman out. A moment later a small crowd high heeled and loafered into the car, looking as high as risen loaves. They laughed in between half drunk coughs. One had an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth. They all spoke as if their mouths were full of bread and they were choking it down, gafawing hard. In the corner, the straw hatted lady looked on at them unimpressed in her corner then slowly away.

Samir's eyebrow twitched and he felt himself waking up a bit. He looked out a window, and witnessed speckled yellow tiles spread across the floor, accompanying the brightly lit tunnel. They were so clean he panicked. He gulped and held himself slowly, wondering who to ask or gesture what was going on, but Samir's English was weak enough to break so he hardly used it. The missing words sat sad and crying nestled behind his tongue.











~ Samir was sure he was on the same train many moments ago, and yet he had no idea where he was. The people were clues standing around him, just back from clubs and bars spitting and shouting odd remarks in thick pasty white accents. But these details were lost on him, they were for someone else.

~ He thought the situation might correct itself in a few and held out a bit more, separate from the unpleasantries of the drunks. He almost got up to approach the group in front of him, but his nerves sat him down again.

* Stop after bloody stop. The oval brightness turned to dark round greyness. It passed quicker and quicker, only the pipes remained in constant view. While the train slowly accumulated rowdy racketeers, Samir pondered the people who still rode with him. The quiet straw hatted African American lady in the corner stared beyond nothing. The Spanish family continued to chat in brief spurts to each other. Samir studied all their faces. They were completely without any doubt. No one was surprised in the least that the world kept changing.

~ The announcer was barely audible above the static that suddenly crashed into the car, now equipped with an accent, "The next station is Marble Arch".

A few talkative bunches got off the train, bumbling. An older balding man stepped on and sat opposite to Samir. And they continued on.








He wondered about his sanity. Maybe he was getting taken back, back to the end of the world, back to the nothing.  He prayed while the whooshing sound of the train nestled into his heart and punched it slowly from the inside, beating harder and harder. Samir sat there in silence, wishing he'd studied more english and biology.

They sped down the only direction they knew for hours. The train car shooped and whooped down its runway in a hurry. The train conductor's voice grew harder and harder to understand. Samir began to give up when it announced "Cowcaddens" and "Ibrox". A rhythm formed whenever the doors flew open and closed, while the newly arriving singles and families grew paler and then darker then paler again. The Spanish family remained on the train, shuffling. The African American lady remained in the corner, reading a newspaper that materialized out of her bag just a moment ago.

Eventually the tunnel lights grew lighter. Samir slumped as they flushed down deeper into the earth. They emerged out of a tunnel, once again cleaner than any station he'd seen in New York. The train receiver twinkled out a few bright sounds, now suspiciously clear, and a low solemn voice pronounced "Valcarca" in a accent. The Spanish family got out excitedly and a few small crowds orderly parked themselves on seats and in corners.

A small jet black haired kid sat next to Samir as his mother stood in front of him. The kid held out a flat aluminum papered stick between his fingers. "¿Chicle?" he offered. His mom glanced at both of them and smiled.

"No, thank you is ok." Samir smiled back, but then he realized "Excuse me, excuse me. Where is here?"

"Qué?" she asked him.

"Where is here?" He asked her, hoping dreadfully she'd understand. He bit his mind nails.

"¿Qué? Eh, Barcelona. Barcelona." She said slowly in a half smile.

"English? You say English?" hopefully.

"Ah, siento. No Inglés" Her face puckered a sad smile. Her son looked out the window and Samir nodded out two thank yous. They sped down the bright fluorescent grey tunnel. Samir thought it half heartedly, and this far in the train was still in on its joke but not laughing as much.

As the people moved on and into each other so did Samir's sighs. People from all corners of the earth bobbled, hopped, dashed, dragged themselves into his car. Stations got dirtier then cleaner then dirtier again. The cars were packed with silent bodies or very bizarre ones. Eventually Samir tired of sitting. He began to feel stale and bland on top of panicked. After quietly making it through the entire train, taking him twenty or so minutes, he had reached the conductor's car.

===========
He tried pulling the emergency break and some people looked at him, the break did nothing.
-==========

He knocked on the door once, harder again, pulled at the handle, but there were no results. The dark glass on the door looked back at him, pitying but stern. Samir took a deep breathe and it did too. Save a handful of people's eyebrows, nothing gave Samir much notice. He felt a bit like a spirit but without the haunting. Like a failed ghost.

It must have been a good five hours since he got on. Since then he had hopped through all the train cars, memorized their numbers, but the situation was the same everywhere. He got sick of the doors opening and closing. He was tired of ducking by children, squeezing by businessmen. But mostly he was tired of sighing. Samir went back to the original car he was on. And while heavily distracted with disappointment and confusion, sleep overtook him. Again slumped in a chair, he began to drift off to the rhythm of the car shaking as it ran on the tracks.

In another hour the train quieted down a bit more. The crowds began thinning out.

When his eyes opened it was just him and the only person who he recognized earlier, the older African American lady with her big hat. They ended up all alone, speeding down yet another dark corridor. Samir walked toward her hopefully, wondering with a heavy heart if she knew where they were headed. She noticed him lazily, pursed her lips and then dropped them. Then again with the lip judgement.

"Excuse?" Samir intended it shyly but it came out perverse. "Where is here?"

"We on the train honey." She said bluntly. A blank stare on Samir's face made her yell "ON. THE. TRAIN."

"Yes, ok. On train. But where?"

"You asking me? Why you asking me?"

"Where do we go?"

"It's ok, we goan hawm." She was quickly losing interest, her eyelids grew heavier and glanced back at her paper.

"It is not ok." Samir began to get angry at how cold she seemed to him, but he couldn't tell if it was New York that hardened him or her or even the train car. The lady didn't budge but then looked straight at him.

"Wha you mean?"

"Why it is ok? We go far. It's not ok. Where do you go?"

"No one forcing you ta stay here. You can ge' off anytime."

The conductor breathed out something unpronouncable as the train slowed to a stop. The lady got up pushing past Samir without another word. A rush of cold air gushed in Samir's face. Between huge white pillars a sign read "Алекса́ндровский сад". He saw her hobble off as the doors closed, bobbling bravely away on the cold concrete ground.

Deserted. Samir didn't feel there was anyone driving even driving the train.

He sat and stayed for another hour, hating the doors opening and closing at places that meant nothing to him. Each time a door opened a new bland painting revealed itself. Walls of black, grey, brick with cracks, some bathed in marble others in pure white stone.

The next stop was deserted, and the train intercom didn't crackle on this time. Samir almost felt the train as exhausted as himself, it's engine whining until a full stop. The sign outside read "도곡　Dogok　谷道".

He stuck his head out the doors looking up and down at the grey and white striped lines. He didn't know when he'd see the grayish black hues of concrete and brick he was used to again. But at that point he didn't much care.

The doors stood open, mocking him for several minutes.

He stopped thinking. He looked out the train both ways. It felt eerily clean and completely silent. He took a step, and walked out. His shoes echoed squeaks in the tunnel. Until he headed up the stairs.

A few moments later, a ringing closed the doors, and in moments they were gone.




















It's a simple moral or rather, life story. You got it where I'm trying to show a fragmented migrant existence. There's a blatant effort to try to familiarize the reader with hopelessness and being lost. Interesting ambiguity is also such a great two words for what I'm trying to convey. Samir has to keep moving even when resting, displaced and exhausted going everywhere but anywhere familiar. He doesn't have a place and needs to embrace that to find one.

Do I need to elaborate on anything?
