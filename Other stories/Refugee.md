The real reason she left was the bullet in the chest. It wasn't fatal but when she opened her eyes the look in her sister's eyes told her to leave while she could.

"Wait, when do you want to come? My mother in law is here it's very far."

"I'm confused. What happened? Do you want to help me or no?"
