While New York was getting built, instead of cleaning up old parts of buildings they built around them. They put scaffolding around the older rooms, and covered the pipes because people don't want to see them. But they still needed people to maintain them (just like it's hard to maintain pipes in a sidewalk). So a deal was struck between the poorer welders/architects/masons that they would work and live in the inner spaces for free as long as they maintained them. This was done in secret to save tons of money for the city.

Over time these people lived in the dark and had to accomodate for space, so they built apartments utilizing all space, upside down and right side up space. They started wearing goggles more because their eye sight was bad, and they all needed to be thin because their spaces were thin.

They had to remain hidden because it was "unattractive" and quite scary for people to know there were peopel maintaining their houses living in their walls.

They influenced many events which were actually secret disputes with city officals and :
- NYC blackouts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_blackout_of_1977
- Floods
- Hurricaine responses

They go about fixing back room subway station electricity, etc.

As a result they became master plumbers and electricians.


What's happening with them recently (maybe)?
- The 250 year old agreement is expiring, so they may all be subject to mass deportation
- Someone from this place wants to overthrow NYC (doesn't fit the theme of vs. class)
- 


Atmosphere is semi steam punk. Has electricity, also they have accents because mixed groups of people who haven't interacted with the outside world.

Possible names for inner city:

- Inner York City
- Old New York City
- New York Innercity
- NY5: New York 5ity
- The Byside (side by side, e.g. side by side with a real apartment)
