A bit of a coincidence, because they just started talking about him ((bad guy, lead in from previous chapter example)).

The mayor sat in his office, his hands on his head thinking about what to do.

There were rolling brown outs all over the city. This didn't mean that things were brown, just that electrity was cutting out infrequently or the voltage was far less than expected. Two black outs happened, and the mayor was trying to reconcile how they happened. No one knew at the power plants, everything was functional and normal from what they could see. It was one of the many problems he dealt with as a mayor, besides the city being close to bankrupt.

The mayor looked out the open window to the city. His hands were shaing and he was getting desperate. So many people relyed on him, and yet all he could do was sweat.

He watched the pigeons land on the sill. They usually never came in, they knew better after his secretary shoo'd them away repeatedly. The mayor also didn't eat anything they liked.

But one pigeon came in the window and flew into his office. Instead of calling his secretary immediately (his finger right above the button), It had had a red crested front and was like no pigeon the mayor ever saw, it was very sleak and looked healthy and clean. Also around its neck was a leather strap holding what looked like a tiny speaker.

"Can you hear me Mr. Mayor?"

The mayor shut his eyes tight then opened them again. The bird was still there, looking around the room, with the box around its neck

"Hello?" The speaker asked.

Reluctantly, the mayor replied, "This is the Mayor of New York City. And you are? A pigeon?"

"ARG." The speaker roared, but then calmed itself down, "My name is not important and something I never intend you to find out. This pigeon is just a vessel."

"A vessel?"

"Ahem, yes. This is not a joke. I'm not playing games."

"Well," the mayor started, "this looks like the very definition of a game. you have a pigeon talking to me."
