Summary: Mr. Thander explains the situation, how he needs electricity, gives him some rare food.
----------

He looked up, there was furniture on the ceiling, cabinets on the walls, picture frames.

"Who is this?" The man demanded, waving his hand in exageratted anger.

The girl didn't seem afraid, she smiled and uttered "He's just visiting Dad. He's gonna help us."

The brain gears ground and turned furiously in her father's head, "Joseline you didn-" But just then there was a knock. Zain couldn't quite place where, but he thought it might be coming from the ceiling.

"Dad!"

"No time to Dad!"

"Quick hide in the closet sir." Behind and above Zain a door opened, and the girl's father pulled two what appeared to be some cranks and pulleys on the walls. Her father yelled, "Mr. FGgdor is that you?" and suddenly, the room began to spin slowly. Zain, startled, fell backwards into the closet door, and before her father closed the door he peered in with a, "Don't say a word, it's bad for the silence." They locked it and could hear them walking on top of the door.

The closet began to shift with the rest of the place. He was flat on his back when it finally stopped. He heard a latch unlock and a few things unbuckle,

"Mr. FGgdor I wasn't expecting you."

"I wasn't expecting you, neither." a deep hollow voice spoke with a joy in it, "a package for you Mr. Thander. How are you Joseline? Not too dusty?"

"It hasn't been dusty at all around here." he heard the girl say. Zain tried to feel around the closet, but nothing felt closet like The back of it was round . 

"Well not up in the fourty and fourties. I've been delivering all day there and they've had it practically pelting them."

"That's no good sir, no good. Joseline will mind herself that's for sure. I'll MAKE SURE of THAT." Mr. Thander spoke emphatically.

"Are you alright Mr. Thander?"

"Quite alright Mr. FGgdor, I was just in the middle of something. Please don't let me ruin your day with this idle chatter. Thank you for delivering it "

"Well I d-"

He glanced at Joseline, "I'm sorry MyboyZain. But what she did was super illegal and quite rude, even though she is right. We are in dire straights and we do need help, but I was hoping it wouldn't resort to this."

Zain asked, "Super illegal? Why?"

"Super illegal. They'd make us move closer to the center, interrogation, whatever."

"Whatever?"

Mr. Thander pulled some cranks, twisted a few knobs. The room started to move again, so they walked around, stepping over various buttons and things before stopping.

"Ok I will explain it. But it's ((a)) nasty business."

Mr. Thander and Joceline pulled on a few handles from the floor. Up came a table and three chairs, sliding out of slots. From a hole in on of the legs Mr. Thander pulled out a map. It was in white and blue and looked very old. The map was covered with tiny diagrams and writing. Mr. Thander had to detach a magnifying glass from his goggle to inspect it.

"This" he pointed at a square, "is where you live. Your problem," he looked Zain sternly in the eye, "is that you don't live in such a great place. It's we call the BySide. We-" he peeled back a paper from the map ((somehow showing what was in between the walls)) "this is us. He pointed at a this rectangle, "we live in your walls."

"In my WALLS?"

"Yes, in fact," he knocked on a pipe, "this is what you hear from your room."

"You're in my walls?!"

Joseline was ignoring them both, feeling sulky and guilty.

"We live in your walls young Z. It is as normal as you waking up, falling asleep and eating breakfast. We are your neighbors, for better or wors-"

"But definitely for better." Joceline chimed in.

"For better! You see!" He pointed at the map, "also, you see this?" He pulled out a magnifying glass from his goggles, "this here-"

"Why is everything so small?"





----------

"Well, we couldn't help but notice your Dad works at the power plant. And as per his working there, he gets his power, to an extent, for free."






"We also know the side people, like us when we have them, value their neighbors. It's the power of being neighborly. Please, if you would, help your neighbors."

They both smiled in unison, as if on cue, and looked long at him.

 

"I understand it's a very heavy thing to ask. It's unfair that we are desperate I know. But desperate people do..." he leaned in closer, "desperate things."

They have moved the main source of their metal maybe from queens to staten island?, and plastic sucks.
