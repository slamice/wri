Zain looked up and there was a girl. She had a huge yellow sweater on that said "Schlitz 1937" in black, long straight black hair, a blue patched jean skirt and leather boots. But the thing that struck Zain were her very thick round glasses. And she was holding Zain's ruler.

"Hey!" Zain screamed. He stuffed his backpack as quick as he could and took off running after the girl.

She flew around a corner in a hurry and zain was only two seconds behind her. But when He turned the corner, the girl had vanished completely. It was just an empty sidewalk, with absolutely no one around.





Zain couldnt believe he was going to lose his grandmother's ruler. He had never been robbed before, and was still in a panic. He walked a few feet ahead of him and noticed something odd.

On a white brick wall, just like any other wall, but it looked like it was flapping just a bit back and fourth. Curious, he pushed it. And instead of a rock hard surface, he fell right into the wall.

Zain didn't really think about where he was, or what he was doing, or how dark it was. All he cared about wad his ruler. And he follow what he thought was the girl's breathing. First he was crawling through a small tunnel, then he stood upright in a very narrow wooden cave.

He heard a door slam and lock, and as he turned a corner he saw it. The door and fit within the walls cracks; it was crooked and as narrow as his body. There was no knob, only a very large key hole. It looked really old, and was covered in English letters that formed nonesense words. He took no time to bang on the door, "Give me back my ruler you theif!"

He heard some scuffle inside, like something moving around in a panic. Something clicked and a light turned on. In tke keyhole he could see a magnified eye looking back at him. (eye hole on doors have fisheyes or types of inverted glass)

"No." The girl's voice said. It sounded more like 'Nao', a bizarre accent.

"Yes! Yuo have to give that back! I know where you live!"

"But I ne~ed it!"

"You can't just steal things you need!"

But there was a pause, and the light inside shut off and the girl's eye was no longer looking out at him.

"I'm going to come back and bring someone to break your door in."

"How did you get in here anyway?"

"Through the wall, just like you."

There was another pause, then a scrambling. She unlocked the door and it opened, but she pushed Zain out of the way as she shut it. She was hurried holding a sack. Instead of glasses she wore huge goggles with a light on its left side. She rushed back up the tunnel. "You're in big trouble." She yelled back.

"Hey wait!" Zain yelled, following her back.

The girl pulled out a rusty paint scraper and dipped it into some liquid from a jar and covered the crack the wall had. It sealed in and it became completely dark wiexcept for the girl's goggles.

"What's so important about your stupid ruler?" The girl asked, scrapping the wall even while it was smooth.

"It's not stupid. I wouldn't tell you anyway. Where is it? And How am I suposed to get out now? And who are you?"

The girl turned around and she had a sad angry face. "I'm sorry." She said quietly, "but I don't need your ruler. Well, I need it, but actually, I need your help."

((Does sealant seal itself or does she have to seal it back?))



Zain, understanding less about what was going on by the minute, tried to push the wall back to no avail. So he followed her.
