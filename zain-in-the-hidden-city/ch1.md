Zain's father moved from the country to work at a factory for money.


Zain laid awake in his bed that night, hearing the clatter downstairs, the noises in the attic, the banging of the pipes in the walls. How could a kid sleep with such a racket? The upper west side apartment they moved to was not what his parents described to him at all.

"Glamorous~!!" his mother exclaimed.

"Class." His father said with a wink.

But so far the sounds kept him awake, night after night. When they lived out in the country he recognized everything. The crickets, the wind, the creaking wood. But what was here in the city that made such sounds? Everything was a grey or painted concrete. Also new brick or crumbling brick. The explanations were always the same.

"The building is old." his mother said one breakfast.

"But just because things are old doesn't mean they have to creak?"

"Things rot and rust and then they don't work." His father chimed in, "some things don't work right anymore and then they do stuff you don't expect. You'll get used to them I promise."

 "What if I don't?" Zain asked, seriously. But his father shrugged happily, as if he shrugged his question out of the window and repeated, "You'll get used to them, I       promise."

Zain tried getting used to them. One week passed, and another week, and a month, and then three months. Every night there were moments of silence, and then a loud bang in the wall, or a weird creak out the window. Only once did he recognize the sound of a pigeon fluttering by, but that was it.

And because of these sounds he could never get to sleep. He'd start to dream abouut his grandmother and riding his bike with her to the market, or picking strawberries on weekends with his parents, because he loved strawberries. But the sounds were disturbing, ugly and creepy. Because he didn't know what they were, so naturally they must be some kind of monsters. Even with the nightlight his mom got him, and with the door left open, Zain had so much trouble sleeping. He was usually tired, and with school starting in two weeks he was worried he wouldn't be able to wake up in time for it.

Of course he asked hi parents to inspect his room,

"Please, does the building manager know?"

"The building may be old Zain but it's not haunted or filled with monsters." His dad smiled, happily but sternly, "I know it's a lot, since we just moved, but give this place a chance."

Zain sighed a "yes father."

His window didn't face teh street but an alley that he never saw anyone in. It was between his building and his neighbor's. Just a dark grey empty court with nothing inside.
