I really hope this doesn't strike you as a surprise. Maybe after you read it you'll see that it isn't. That in some way you expected this, maybe hoped for it. But more likely you forgot it completely in your mind. You burnt it. Or cut it up with a butterfly knife.

There was a wall of understanding I couldn't breach. I don't think anyone could breach it. I'm not even sure if it was voluntary. Was it? It' impossible for me to have known.

I was already steeped in some really deep immaturity. In a way you were so as well, who wouldn't be in that kind of environment. But in another way it seemed like you were lonely. And you were looking for something else, something that was beyond.



You wanted me to understand, at least at some point? I could never tell.
