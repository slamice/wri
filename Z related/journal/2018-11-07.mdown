Still fuming. I've run over scenarios for Zain's Qaurterly meeting 100 times in my head. I can't believe how unprofessional and uncaring these people are.

Rumi and I weren't sure what to do until we talked ot Christina. She said consider that Kindergarten and First great will be academic heavy.  She made a lot of good points. Can Zain do those things? We're leaning towards 12:1:1 again.

We need written notes. Going to make sure we have them going into the IEP meeting.
