Tuesday November 6th

Had a tough time today. Very stressed. Zain is sick today. Zain's special Ed teacher lied in an email about giving us daily verbal updates on Zain's progress. She had not given us much feedback.

Zain's ST, Mr. Roger, also refused to give any written feedback for his upcoming IEP Quarterly meeting.

Talked to Burandi, Zain's para. She said he needs more speech.

This sucks big time.
