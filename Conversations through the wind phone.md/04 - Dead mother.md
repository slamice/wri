((Narrator is a she))

I met up with the gardener at the door. He had so many visitors but he was content with all of them. He understood better than any of them how it felt to lose someone close, but he admitted every time that it must be hard, and he was more than happy to have the booth up for everyone to visit and talk to those long gone.

And I shook his hand too and bowed and did what you do. He was on his way out and we walked to his car together. Before he drive off he grabbed me by the shoulder and said take all the time you need, but talking on the phone for such a while could be tiring for the living let alone the dead. Hetried to make it lighthearted, I knew and I feigned a smile and then let a real one appear on my lips.


The garden was nice, I thought, he did a great job.

I approached it weary. The glass box, with a notebook, a phone and little else. I opened it, shut it and stood in there.

I tried to hold in my grief but I couldn't and I let it out through my mouth with a sigh instead of through tears.

I picked up the receiver and it was dead, there was no sound. I couldn't hear anything then, just the beating of my heart thumping away.

"Hello." I spoke solemnly in the earpiece. The ring tone was dead, and I sat standing in silence.

"We were suppo-" I paused, "My bed feels very empty now."

More silence.

"You'll be happy to know I don't feel that pain in my arm anymore, the one I used to get, remember?" I lied "maybe you know why it was there now. I think it was when I got home and it was my feeling it got when it missed holding you." The wind rustled.

"Yes I know I thought about it a lot"


((says a bit, walks away from phone but phone then rings))
















- Last person in phone booth actually gets a call from the dead



The voice was without any static and it appeared so clear, as if it was almost in his thoughts were it not coming from a telephone hook. He found it a relief that the afterlife's connection was better than the networks he was used to.
