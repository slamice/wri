questions au:

■ What brings out the best in your child?
■ What supports, if any, are needed for your child to
maintain positive behavior?
■ What does your child like to do outside of school?
In addition, you may want to ask questions of the teacher
and other school staff that will help you understand how
to help your child grow and progress. For example,
■ What sorts of questions should I ask my child as we
read together?
■ How can I help my child if he/she is struggling with
homework?
■ What are some learning activities I can do at home
or in the neighborhood?
■ Does my child get along well with the other students
in school?
■ Does my child have difficulty following directions or
doing what is asked of him or her? What do you do
if that happens in class?
■ Are there specific interventions that are being used
to address any difficulties my child is having?
■ What can you tell me (what have you noticed) about
how my child learns?
■ Is my child learning at a rate that is expected at this
stage of development?
