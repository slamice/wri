Huck Out West - Robert Coover:

Take away was style. Coover really captured the style of speaking from Huck Finn. The plot is an ongoing neverending trollop. Very plot propelled narrative.

Character development: Huck did simply have a natural born tendency to do good. The only thing he grew to hate was moderinzing capitalistic people, cowboys... True cowboys.
