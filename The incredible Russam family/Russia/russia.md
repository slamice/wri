Baba Yaga keeps showing up




-----

Baba yaga got in, what looked like, A giant omrtar. She picked up a ridiculously heavy pestel qnd started pushing against the ground, in agony, trying to move.

"Nnnnnghhhh... I'll take you there." She said between breathes, going no where.

"Why are you riding this?" little Zain said. "Mm..." Ruby cooed softly, i very confused bird puzzlement, tipping her head.

"Well," yagggy sighed, "it usedto be more useful, it used to fly. But I didn't maintain it over the years. You know, things get old."

"You always rode in this?"

"I did have some horses, but they were made out of fire. Very difficult to ride... Nnnnnnggghh." The mortar moved an inch, miraculously. "In hindsight it probably wasnt a good idea to buy them."
