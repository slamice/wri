The Russam family

1.

Have you ever heard of the Russam family?



Here they are together. From left to right:

father Mariam  big brother Rumi  big brother  Zain ...   and Ruby, their bird








The children didn't really mind the hard work, but it made them hate potatoes. Every meal was potatoes. A potato breakfast didn't taste much different than a potato lunch or dinner. Even looking at a potato irritated them.

Ruby also hated potatoes. After eating half of one, she threw the other across the room and yelled "potato!"

Everyday the children woke up, sighed, and went to work. Shovelling and hoeing. Mariam prepared the bread, cleaned the house, did the laundry. The children and the father tolled in their small field, happy because they were together, sad because they hated potatoes.

"I hate potatoes." Said Zain.

"They are awful." Said his older brother.

"I never want to see any potatoes, but I even dream about them too." Said his older sister.

"Everyday." Said the oldest.

They only comfort in the whole world was chess. A game their father taught them and played with them every night.

Ruby also tilled the ground, hitting and scratching the first with a tiny hoe. Every so often

One day an old man ride in on a horse to their house. They took him in and prepared some potatoes.

Main plot is ppl know that czar Ivan is crazy, so they send a peasant to tell him the war began in Lithuania(somewhere else?). They send his family because they think that he'd spare them, but he doesn't. After a few incidents they go to the palace, then flee.

Chapter 20. The match:

"I'll play... With the bird."

"With ruby?!" The Russam family gasped.

Any one of them felt they had a chance to beat the Czar. He thought no one practiced chess but they did in secret for years... But Ruby?



The guards opened the cage and took Ruby out. She gave a slow growl at them as they put her in front of the chess board. She tried to bite their hands but was soon distracted by the board. The Czar looked on horribly with a horrible face.



The room was absolutely silent. Zain held his breath and gulped down a thick gulp. His older brother did as well. And _his_ older sister. And her older brother. And then both their parents.



"You first." (Your move?) The Czar whispered.



What happened next every historian confuses. Some people say the czar suffered from a heart attack or indigestion,  while others say it was a stroke.

But what really happened was nearly impossible. People can barely explain it. But sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth is this.

Ruby tilted her head and looked at the pieces. The Russam family leaned in closer.

Vlad The guard touched the blade of his axe. The Czar slowly smiled a twisted smile.

Then, looking at the board, he frowned in disgust.

Ruby walked over and grabbed one piece with her beak. She then put it back on the board.

"Checkmate" Ruby said. With one move, she defeated the czar and made the best move in chess history.

"What?!" The czar screamed a huge scream, the whole palace heard it.

His shame, honour and dignity were all shattered. His was angrier than all his previous angers put together. His blood boiled, so much so that he boiled himself from the inside. He took one last gasp at Ruby, then fell back in his chair dead.



As the guards rushed towards him, the Russam family rushed to the doors. They hailed for Ruby













What happened next shocked every historian studying the Russam family.
