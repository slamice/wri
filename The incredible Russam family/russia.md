The Russam family sat snug around a very big fire in the heart of a Russian winter.

Basel, the father,

Mariam, the mother

the four kids, 15 13 10 7, in that order,

and Ruby the parrot.

A letter arrives from a mysterious man.

It invites the family to the Russian Tzar's palace.

They met some magic people, around then many people believed in magic and it was fairly common to magicize things.




Bad guy challenges Ruby the parrot in the end for a game of chess. Ruby wins with one move.
