One day an ant, like all the others
was walking with its sisters and brothers

But the ant stopped suddenly, clearing its throat,
"What can I know? What ought I do? What can I hope?"

"Hey!" yelled another ant, "who's holding up the line?"
"You know we've got a lot of work to do and not much time!"
