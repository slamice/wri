Comedy

- A friend of mine told me it was amatuer night so I came here to see it, but didn't realize it was amatuer comedy night so half the room went home.

Yes it's a sex joke. Sex is funny. Dicks! Dicks.

Please laugh at me.

- Someone told me (television) to picture everyone in the audience naked so you can feel confident.

I did this at my very first show and it was a disaster for a few reasons:

It's a very taxing strategy. You start and you look around, and you're wondering where all the moles are. The gashes, the bruises. You got to map them all out. Does she have an innie belly button? How many warts on that guy?

Second thing is, I don't think it'll help because then I'll feel left out.





What the hell is petroleum jelly?

I have eczema so I was told to out petroleum jelly on my hands.

Sounds like something I would put on if I wanted to light myself on fire.

Vaseline is.... Petroleum jelly

Theres nothing natural about this stuff


It says on it, 100 percent. PURE. Petroleum jelly.






- Why do we do checkups? Does it make any sense?

Let a doctor hear your heart beat... "Hmm, yup still alive"


Dentist looks at your teeth, sees some black spots. "Brush more"

The message is look for black spots! Not hard people.

So I bushed my teeth more. I cam back and my dentist said "you completely turned your mouth around."

And I said "You're mouth was always turned around! You've been talking out of your ass this whole time!"




- Flossing joke

Flossing depresses me.

It's because you're gathering up all the food you failed to eat.
And there are only two outcomes after your floss, which are also depressing.
Either you throw it all out or you eat it in a very unsatisfying way.







Going to the doctor






Big ass donut joke

Giving keys to the city for superheroes is a hoax



Data map over time of rap artist lyrics or word cloud, see which jokes come up


"Unlike other comedians I can back up my jokes with science!"

Toast joke.

Toast is unbelievable. You make bread, cook it and everything. Then you out it out for people to eat.

They take the bread


Burn it


Then eat that


Does it make any sense?
