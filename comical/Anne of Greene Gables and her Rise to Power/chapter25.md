CHAPTER XXV. Matthew Insists on Puffed Sleeves

Yes he loves em in more ways than a few, that lark.

Anne was privy in the living room parading her friends around her to ominous music for an upcoming school play. Her friends were circling her courtesying shakily, obviously so tired their knees could hardly put out another squat. Anne was in the middle. She spun, her arms raised in the air, her head flung back with a fountain of demands streaming out of her.  A techno march danced in her head while dream after dream of her absolute monarchy came true in it.

Matthew Cutthroat was in pure shock. He could have cut his _own_ throat after seeing that. The girls were soon too turned to move, so they scurried clumsily away out of the house barely walking. Anne assured them they'll practice again tomorrow until they get "The Fairy Queen" down tight. Marilla's Gorilla shrunk in a corner and into his sweater like a Dracula snail as the girls slumped out.

Creepily, he watched the girls put on their bonnets, boots and outer corsets on while Anne simply patted down her dress. Matthew looked at the sack Anne wore and then back at the other girls. Then back at Anne. Then back at the other girls, then back at Anne. Like a spectre in the dark he studied them until they were out the door.

Something was off, and it came to Matthew while hacking on his pipe smoke with Marilla shaking her head in disgust later that evening...

The clothes! The other girls wore lace and fine cottons. Their pocket lint was balls of silk. Mrs. Plebb's only ever made Anne's dresses in one color, dirt.

Like the mill he worked with his hands, another mill ground non-creepy girls dress thoughts in his head. The other girls wore pink bows and came each day with all colors of the rainbow. Anne had a flower stapled to her dress.

Fashion areas as distant to him as Antartica. Also the sleeves! The other girls' were so puffy, like little white bread loaves draped around their arms. He'll buy her one, COME ON! Two days before christmas. He was ridiculously satisfied with his discovery, and soon after he conked out.

The next day he headed carmodying to the store. The Cutthroats usually only dealt with one stop shop William Blake's makes. But he wanted to get Anne something over a nickel, so he headed to the infamous S&L's Chic Boutique, where only the finest gabelers shopped.

ALAS! DISDAIN! Who behind the counter but a lovely blossomy woman. Matthew could barely keep up a conversation with the three people he knew. This would surely kill him.

She had a huge, drooping... Pompadour. Big, rolly polly eyes and a most extensive and bewildering, hmm.... Smile. Her name was Lucilla.

"What can I get you Mr. Plebb?" She said smacking down the table, then trying to rub the smack in. Bangles trinkled and chinkled audibly down her arms like music. Even her eyebrow tick seduced him.

"Jesus" Matthew whispered to himself. Yea good luck with this.

"Well?" She slammed her hands down again, like an interrogator. She snapped her jaw.

"Um..." he felt his face getting whiter and deader than usual, " Garden rakes? Sugar? Mulch? Mulchy sugar?"

"We only have mulchy sugar unfortunately, and a few weed wackers." She said, yawning. Another crazy old person at the Gables. "White or brown?"

Matthew tried really hard but couldn't resist, and spat out "BROWN" in a hurry.

"Take the barrel over there. It comes in barrels."

She counted out his change and soon he made off carrying the barrel bow legged, a weed wacker strapped to his back.

"I'm not even going to ask why you got us this, will I? Why did you get it?" Marilla befummled. "I can't make anything with this except a poor pear cobbler and an even poorer donut." She threw a scoop into the barrel in disgust.

"Sweet things should be sweet" Matt threw up philosophically.

Marilla's gorilla obviously was flustered. He had no choice but to take his pathetic request to Mrs. Lindt. Only a true pure chocolate of a lady could understand a heavenly cocoa colored childhood wt=ith sleeves that puffed beyond words. Like disproportionately blown up clown balloons. He fetcher her at once.

"Afraid of dresses? Make a dress for Anne? Alright I'll do it. I'm heading out to the comrodary anyway. I believe a rich brown, dirtish color would look amazing on Anne. I'll make it to fit my niece to the Jenny Gills to the gills. They are both teenage girls after all so size is no object."

"Perhaps," Mathew chime, "a different color, and have the sleeves be a bit more, err, modern?"

Marilla knew. Puffed sleeves were the talk of the town, people were going nuts blowing into their shoulders and wrists every few moments all across Canada to get a taste. "She'll have to fight off all the Armanis and Versaces with her bare hands". Mrs. Lindt nodded greedily. Air Balloons of puffs were in her head clinking champagne glasses at the Emmy's, the Grammy's and the White House.

"Wow," the chocolate hag thought out loud, "I'm certainly impressed. I would never think that guy had any sense of childhoodedness. He must fancy himself a perverted fashionable rumplestilstkin, undressing with his eyes and then redressing with huge marshmellowed arms. How could Marilla possibly understand a teenage style fandango. Hell, how could she even understand looking good and puffy?"

Mrs. Plebb didn't know until Christmas eve with chestnut smells encroaching on the people's noses' decrees. Mrs. Lyndt sewed up something hip and nasty, and when Marilla caught wind she was blown over, surprised and disgusted. "This will just play into Anne's unbearable vanity. I've been making dresses since I was in the womb, three of them for Anne. I had no room for puffy sleeves not then and not now!"

Christmas morning soon broke it all up. There was snow everywhere outside, and Anne tumbled down the stairs wondering what beautiful things lay before her to see and conquer. She sang at the Green Gables and they gabled back loyally. "Merry of all the christmasses! Plebbs, this is such a beautiful white christmas we got ourselves into. All green christmasses can kiss it!" Yes, we discover Anne is clearly a weather racist.

Matthew, sweating from every pore, wiping his hands on his overalls every few seconds, meekly handed Anne her new dress. Marilla watched from the kitchen, with eyes like one of those paintings that follow you around the room.

"This present is a dress present." Matthew coughed out in a high voice. Anne took it, and beholded it. It had seams, buttons and entails. The color was a fertilizer blackish brown hue. It was very ribbony, and there was a ruffle of lace at the tube neck. There were sleeves sewn on top of sleeves to puff beyond her imagination.

Matthew tried to stutter out a "Don't you like it?" or "How do you sleeve yourself now?". But was so overcome by doing something besides weeding a rope of spittle piffled down onto the wooden floor.

"I've only ever dreamt of small sleeves, how ridiculous I was! I shall wear this dress TO OCCASSIONS! Thank you." Anne shrugged at the sight of a week meek Matt, but smiled at the dress and sat it on her head, wondering when she'd have enough silk to make the neckline higher.

"Breakfast has been prepared. I didn't think you needed more dresses, but since Mathew got it for you, you should take good care of it."

Anne loved getting dainty, high order gifts way more than the next person, "Eating seems like such a commonplace task compared to this. I'd like to feast my eyes on the dress. It's such a turkey dinner I might get cateracts. Somehow it's hard now," Anne thought now, shaking in excitement, "Somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistable temptations come."

When the common place peon breakfast was over, Dianna appeared as a fleck on the hillside. She strode closer, just in time for Anne to grab her new dress and flaunt it like crazy. "Check it out Diana. This christmas is popping. Check out this sleeve action here."

"Here," Diana posied breathlessly, "I would have brought these over last night, but I thought maybe you're scary at night on christmas eve so I convinced myself today was good."

Anne opened the box and peered inside. Inside were golden slippers. With beaded toes, satin bows, glistening buckletes and yes, puffy sleeves as well. "OH EM GEE" Anne mouthed.

"You won't have to wear slippers too big for you for us to hear you shuffle in them." Could Anne's eyes get wider for the excitement at the concert tonight?

All the scholars from all the villages of Canada were there. The people of Onion Lake, Meat Cove, Homeville... the aching peasantries were eagerly waiting. The hall was decorated heavily like a few fat men. It got really crowded with the whole cast on stage, but Anne made it clear she was the peacock of the bunch. Just like her speeches, she reigned hard. She belted out off key tunes and whipped the audience's faces with broken melodies and half notes hanging off the sides of the stage. Girls danced around her, sacrificing their shoes, feet, throats for what they thought was the show. They shuffled hard medival turned modern dance summersaults. Anne grinned "No one could be apathetic after that. Come on."

"I guess," Diana counted after the epic, "we made ten dollars. Our names will be in the newspapers, fonted in bold and italic."

"A million eyes were on us Diana. Eyes from every coroner of Canada. Bewitching us. taunting us. Always hungry, always wanting more. And we gave them all of it. I knew I must live up to those sleeves Diana." They were so frouf Anne brushed them out of her face as she said it, "Did I groan alright?"

"You groaned perfectly." Diana replied. "Did you see though, how when you ran off the stage and a rose fell out of your costume? Gilbert Godfried, he put it in his pocket."

Anne threw whatever Diana said then over her shoulder. "I hope he chokes on it."

That night, Mr. and Mrs. Plebb were exhausted. They hadn't been to a concert in 20 years. They wore their best clothes stowed away from the attic, which were so old they had to be exhumed, refitted and exhorcised from poltergeists.

"Anne really did a number on us. She's only thirteen in March too, she really slaughtered that packed house." Matthew said earnestly, or as earnest as he could sound while wheezing.

"She's got some kind of future alright..." Marilla trailed off, while Matthew played at his sleeve, half dreaming.
